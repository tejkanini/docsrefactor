# SEMOSS Docker Installation
SEMOSS supports two ways of running locally: 
1. [Fully local installation](Local%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md)
2. [Docker container](#docker-installation-guide)

This guide will show the steps for installing **Docker** and running SEMOSS in a Docker container. 
For instructions on how to perform a fully local installation of SEMOSS instead, click **[here](Local%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md)** for the **backend** installation instructions and **[here](Frontend%20Installation.md)** for the **frontend** instructions.

> **Note**
> If you don't need admin privileges and would prefer a **lightweight, low management** way to connect to SEMOSS, then use the [live web server](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/) instead of following this guide. Instructions to set up a connection to the web version can be found in the [Connecting to SEMOSS](../How%20To/Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md) guide.
     
## Docker Installation Guide

> **Note**
> **Quick Link**: If you already created a Docker container for SEMOSS by following this guide, then you can jump directly to the shortcuts below to start your server:
>  * **For Windows:** [Running an Existing Docker Container on Windows](#running-an-existing-docker-container-on-windows)
>  * **For Mac OSX:** [Running an Existing Docker Container on Mac](#running-an-existing-docker-container-on-mac)

### Download Docker
If you already have Docker installed, you can skip to the next step ([Accessing the SEMOSS Docker Repository](#accessing-the-cfg-ai-docker-repository)).

If this is your first time installing Docker, please follow the installation guides for your operating system linked below:
* [Windows Docker Installation Guide​](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
* [OSX/Mac Docker Installation Guide​](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* [Windows/Max install without Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Accessing the SEMOSS Docker Repository
* Please reach out to your administrator to get access to the SEMOSS Docker Repository. You can only continue with the rest of the guide after receiving access.
* After being granted Docker repository access, log into the repository via Deloitte SSO.
  - If you are not automatically redirected to the SSO login, then click on the button that says **"Login via OIDC Provider"** to be redirected to the Deloitte SSO login.
![DockerRepo](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/repo.png)
* After logging in, **click on your username in the top right hand corner**, then click **User Profile** in the dropdown menu.
* In your user profile, look for the **CLI secret** field. Click on the blue copy icon to the right to copy it to your clipboard.
![secretkey](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/secretkey.png)
* Make sure that your Docker Desktop is currently running. If it is not, then launch the Docker Desktop app.
* Open up a new command prompt/terminal and enter the following command: `docker login DOCKER_REPOSITORY_URL`, and replace `DOCKER_REPOSITORY_URL` with the repository link that your administrator provided you.
  - It will take a few moments to connect.
  - When it prompts for your username, enter your **Deloitte email address**
  - When it prompts for your password, hit ctrl-V *ONCE* to paste the password that you copied from your user profile details (or command-V for Mac), then hit enter.  
    - **Note: The password will not appear in the terminal when you paste it**, so be careful to only hit ctrl-v/command-V once (and do not type in anything else), followed by enter.
  - It may take a few moments for the authentication to complete. Once complete, a message will say **"Login succeeded"**

## Windows Instructions
### Download the Helper Scripts
* Click [here](../../static/assets/windows_docker_starter_scripts.zip) to download a zip file called `windows_docker_starter_scripts.zip`.
* Unzip this folder to any location and copy its path. This guide will refer to this path as `SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR`. For example, in the image below, the `SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR` folder path is `C:\workspace\cfgai-docs\assets\windows_docker_starter_scripts`
  ![SEMOSS Docker Directory](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/SemossDockerDir.png)

### Set Up Your Container and Volume
* Open up a command prompt and navigate to the `SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR` by running `cd SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR` (replace `SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR` with the actual folder path you copied in the previous step).
> **Note**
> The helper scripts default to using port 8080 to host SEMOSS. If port 8080 is blocked on your computer and you wish to use a different port, then use any text editor (VSCode or Notepad++) to edit both **init.bat** and **startAIServer.bat** by replacing the `8080` in the lines that say `set ACTIVE_PORT=8080` with your desired port number

* In the command prompt, type `init.bat` and hit enter.
  - You will see some output and auto-executed commands appear (see below image for reference) while Docker pulls the image and the script runs. This process may take up to 45 minutes depending on your connection speed.
![init.bat Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/initBatOutput.png)
* Once it completes, your browser window will automatically open 2 tabs.
* Access the tab at http://localhost:8080/Monolith/setAdmin/ to designate an admin user.
  ![Admin Username](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/AdminUsername.png)
    - You will see a table appear with an input field to enter your admin credentials.
    - Since we are creating a native account, you can enter in any username you want.  Please remember the username you entered.
    - Click "Submit" after typing in your username. Do not worry if the page does not respond/redirect: this is normal. As long as you clicked the submit button, your admin username has been stored.
* Close this tab and navigate to the other tab at http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/ and click on the **Register Now** link
  ![Native Registration Button](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/NativeRegistrationButton.png)
    - Fill out the fields for Name, Last Name, Username, Email Address, Password, and Confirm Password.
  ![Register User](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/RegisterUser.png)
    - **Important**: Make sure your the username you enter matches the username that you created earlier when setting up your admin account.
* The page will return to the login after successfully creating your account. Enter the username and password you just created, then click **"Login with Native"**.
  ![Native Login Entry](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/NativeLoginEntry.png)
* The page will redirect to the SEMOSS App Library Landing page.
  ![App Library Landing](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/AppLibraryLanding.png)
* Return to your command terminal, making sure it is still in the `SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR`.
* Run:
  - `cloneAIServer.bat`
  - `startAIServer.bat`
  ![cloneAIServer.bat and startAIServer.bat output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/cloneAndStartBat.png)

### Shutdown and Clean Up
* To stop running the Docker container, open up a new command terminal, then run:
  -  `cd SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR`
  -  `stopAIServer.bat`

### Running an Existing Docker Container on Windows
* To start running a container, open up a command prompt at the `SEMOSS_DOCKER_DIR` and run `startAIServer.bat`

## Mac OSX Instructions
### Pulling the Docker Image
* Navigate to the Docker Repository URL that your administrator provided to you. You will see a list of projects.
* Click on the **genai** project, and then **genai/genai-server**.
  ![repo2](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/repo2.png)
* In the table that appears, look for the header that says **"Push Time"**. Click twice on this header to sort the table from **most recent to oldest**.
* In the first row on the table (the most recent image), click on the **"Copy"** icon in the **"Pull Command"** column.
![repo3](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/repo3.png)
* In a command prompt/terminal, paste the command that you just copied. It should start with `docker pull DOCKER_REPOSITORY_URL ...`
  - It may take a while (between 5 - 45 minutes, depending on your internet connection speed) to finish pulling. 

### Creating a New Docker Container from the Image
* Enter the following command to list your images: `docker images`
* Find the row in the output that says `DOCKER_REPOSITORY_URL/genai/genai-server` under the **REPOSITORY** heading. This corresponds to the image that was just pulled.
  ![Docker Images Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/DockerImages.png)
* Copy the value under **IMAGE ID** for that row.
* Tag your image with a nickname called `genai-image` by executing the following command: `docker tag YOUR_IMAGE_ID genai-image:latest`
  - Replace `YOUR_IMAGE_ID` in the above command with the actual **IMAGE ID** that you copied from the previous step.
  - `latest` identifies that this is the **most recent** image.
      ![Docker Tag Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/DockerTag.png)
* Enter the following command to run a container from the image: `docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name genAI genai-image`
  -  **-d tag:** The `-d` tag runs the Docker container in **detached mode**, which allows the container to keep running even after you close the command line/terminal window.
    If you want the Docker container to automatically shut down when you close the command line/terminal, you can **omit the `-d` tag**.
  - **`-p` tag:** The `-p` tag, followed by the `8080:8080` argument, specifies the mapping of the container port (8080) to your local machine's port (8080).
      - If you already have a different process running on port 8080 locally, you can replace the **first** `8080` with any other open port (ex. `9090:8080`).
  - **`--name` tag:** This allows you to specify a nickname/alias for your container. We set it to `genAI`, but you can replace it.
  - **`genai-image`**: This is the nickname for the image that we tagged in the previous step.
* After you enter the command, you will see an alphanumeric string output in the command prompt/terminal.
  ![Docker Run Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/DockerRun.png)
* You can verify that the container is running by entering the following command: `docker ps`
  - This will list all of the containers you have running. You should see a row with the name `genAI` (or whatever alias you set in your `docker run` command).
* In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/
  - **Hint**: If you used a different port than 8080 in your `docker run` command, make sure to replace it in the above link.
  ![Initial Login](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/InitialLogin.png)
* Accept the cookies if prompted, and you will see the SEMOSS login landing page.
  - Note that this login page will not have an option to enter username/password yet as we still need to enable native user account registration.

### Creating an Admin and Registering for a Native Account
* Return to your command line/terminal window, and run the following command to connect to a bash shell inside of the container: `docker exec -it genAI /bin/bash`
     ![Docker Exec Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/DockerExec.png)
    - If you named your container something different than `genAI`, then replace `genAI` with the alias you set.
    - If you enter the shell successfully, you should see that the terminal prompter looks like: `root@XXXXXXXX/opt/semoss-artifacts/artifacts/scripts`
* In the shell, run the following commands:
  - `cd /opt/semosshome/`
  - `sed -i 's|<NATIVE_ENABLE>|true|' social.properties`
  - `sed -i 's|<NATIVE_REGISTRATION_ENABLE>|true|' social.properties`
  - `sed -i 's|<REDIRECT>|http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist|' social.properties`
  - `head social.properties`
    ![Bash Commands](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/BashCommands.png)
* Verify that the first 4 lines of output from the last command match what is below:
  ```
   redirect http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist

    #Logins Enabled/Disabled
    native_login true
    native_registration true
  ``` 
* Next, run the following commands:
  - `$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/stop.sh`
  - `$TOMCAT_HOME/bin/start.sh`
    ![Tomcat Restart](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/TomcatRestart.png)
* You will see some logs and output begin to appear in the terminal. Return to a browser window and navigate to http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/
    ![Native Login](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/NativeLogin.png)
* Verify that an option to enter a username and password has now appeared on the login page. Do not login or register yet.
* Now, you will designate an admin user. Navigate to this link: http://localhost:8080/Monolith/setAdmin/
    ![Admin Username](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/AdminUsername.png)
    - You will see a table appear with an input field to enter your admin credentials
    - Since we are creating a native account, you can enter in any username you want.  Please remember the username you entered.
    - Click "Submit" after typing in your username. Do not worry if the page does not respond/redirect: this is normal. As long as you clicked the submit button, your admin username has been stored.
* Return to http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/ and click on the **Register Now** link
    ![Native Registration Button](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/NativeRegistrationButton.png)
    - Fill out the fields for Name, Last Name, Username, Email Address, Password, and Confirm Password.
      ![Register User](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/RegisterUser.png)
    - **Important**: Make sure your the username you enter matches the username that you created earlier when setting up your admin account.
* The page will return to the login after successfully creating your account. Enter the username and password you just created, then click **"Login with Native"**.
  ![Native Login Entry](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/NativeLoginEntry.png)
* The page will redirect to the SEMOSS App Library Landing page.
  ![App Library Landing](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/AppLibraryLanding.png)

### Stopping the Container
To stop the container, open up a **new command prompt/terminal** and enter the following command: `docker stop genAI`
* If you named your container something different than `genAI`, then replace `genAI` with the alias you set.
![Docker Stop Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/DockerStop.png)

> **Warning**
>  Do not delete your `genAI` docker container. If you accidentally delete it using `docker rm`, `docker system prune`, or `docker container prune`, then you must redo the steps starting from the [Creating a New Docker Container from the Image](#creating-a-new-docker-container-from-the-image) section of this guide.

### Running an Existing Docker Container on Mac
Now that you have created a Docker container to run SEMOSS, you can run it directly by entering `docker start genAI` in a command line/terminal. Then, navigate to http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/ in your browser to log in. 
![Docker Start Output](../../static/img/DockerBEInstall/DockerStart.png)

# Local SEMOSS Front End Installation Guide

## Overview

The main way that you'll interact with a Gen AI app is through the SEMOSS server. By using the SDK you will be able to access the data that you have stored inside your server. However, you can also setup SEMOSS to run locally. 

There are several reasons why this might be useful to you, the main one being that you will have admin privileges back in, and that you can change the SEMOSS interface to fit your needs more directly. 

This guide will go through what steps to take to get SEMOSS to run locally as a frontend server.

## Prerequisites

### Node.js
You can install Node on your machine by downloading the appropriate installer for your device directly from the Node.js website. Version [v18.16.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.16.0/) is suggested for our projects (for most Windows machines, you should download `node-v18.16.0-x64.msi`). 

### Code Editor
You'll need to have your code editor of choice downloaded on your machine. We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Setting up a Project Directory

In order to have SEMOSS running locally, you will need to also supplement it with a running backend. You can find a guide to getting your local backend set up using this [link](Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md).

Once you have your backend structure set up we will navigate to your workspace folder, and select our tomcat server:
![Tomcat Server](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/choosingTomcat.png)

Within the tomcat folder we will navigate to our webapps folder. This is where our UI will reside. 

![Webapps](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/webapps.png)

Now navigate to the webapps folder in your local terminal. 

![Local Terminal](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/terminal.png)


Once you have your terminal setup, you can navigate to the SEMOSS repository in github

[SEMOSS UI repository](https://github.com/Deloitte-Default/cfgai-ui)

If this link does not properly open up for you, then please email SEMOSS@deloitte.com to request access.

Inside of the repository click the green code button and copy the code for cloning the repo. You can click the circled button to copy the link that is there. 

![Cloning](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/gitClone.png)

Once you have this link you can go back to your open terminal and clone the repository into your webapps folder. 

![terminal cloning](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/cloning.PNG)

This will download all of the necessary folder structure into your webapps component. 

# Installation and Server Setup

### Step 1: Node Package Manager (NPM) setup
You should have Node installed, that will be our package manager of choice. There are instructions for how to install this in our Prerequisites portion. 

You can check that they exist on your machine by typing the following code in a terminal. 

```
    node -v
    npm -v
```

If these output versions, that means that you have a working version of npm on your computer. If you do not go back to prerequisities and make sure to download Node (and npm alongside it). 

We will be using npm to install pnpm, which is a lighter package manager. 

To do so open a terminal and install it using:

```npm install -g pnpm```

### Step 2: Installing SEMOSS's packages

Now that we have access to pnpm we are ready to install all necessary SEMOSS packages. 

Navigate to your newly created repository inside of webapps, open the `SEMOSS-ui` folder inside of your code editor of choice. 

![VS Code terminal](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/semossuiterminal.PNG)

We are going to open a new terminal inside of VS code for the next few portions. You can use an external terminal as well, the results will be the same. 

Inside the root folder of SEMOSS we are going to run 

```pnpm install```

This will go through all of the contents of the `package.lock` file and download them. For reference, here is the [package.lock file](https://github.com/Deloitte-Default/cfgai-ui/blob/dev/package.json)

The install command will also go through and install of the packages that each portion of SEMOSS uses so it might take some time. 

### Step 3: Setting Up Your .env.local file

When we run the Frontend server we are pointing it to a specific backend route to follow. This will be your locally setup backend server that is outlined in the documentation here: [Backend Install](Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md)

If you followed the same naming conventions as those outlined in the above documentation then you can create a new file in your root folder and name it

`.env.local` 

You will notice that it will live right underneath the already created `.env` file. It should also appear to look greyed out, this is because it will be ignored by git, so your local preferences will not be pushed up with the rest of your work. 

Inside of the newly created local enviornment file you should add these specifications:

```
ENDPOINT=../../../..
MODULE=/Monolith_Dev
```

Your final outcome should look like this:

![local env](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/envlocal.png)

### Step 4: Starting your Frontend Server

Within your package.json you should see several scripts that will help run your server. 

During this process your backend server must be up and running, so please review the [Backend Installation Guide](Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md) to make sure that it is correctly setup. 

```
    "scripts": {
        "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm",
        "prepare": "husky install",
        "dev": "pnpm run --filter=@semoss/legacy --filter=@semoss/ui --filter=@semoss/client --stream --parallel dev",
        "dev:ui-client": "pnpm run --filter=@semoss/ui --filter=@semoss/client --stream --parallel dev",
        "dev:client": "pnpm run --filter=@semoss/client --stream --parallel dev",
        "build": "pnpm run --filter=@semoss/legacy --filter=@semoss/ui --filter=@semoss/client build",
        "fix": "pnpm run --filter=@semoss/legacy --filter=@semoss/ui --filter=@semoss/client fix"
    },
```

We are only going to focus on two of them. `dev` and `dev:ui-client`. 

If it is the first time that you are running the server, you must run it using 

```pnpm run dev```

This will go through each individual package, bundle them, and create a local server. Afterwards, you may want to shift over to using 

```pnpm run dev:ui-client``` since it is slightly lighter-weight. 


***Please Note*** The server takes a long time to run. If the webpack seems to be compiled, and you get a ui module not found error, that means you need to wait longer. 

### Step 5: Accessing your local server

Once your webpack has compiled you can navigate over to 

```http://localhost:9090/semoss-ui/packages/client/dist/#/```

Here you will have to register a user using the native registration. 

![Registering](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/registering.png)

Once you've registered a user, you can use the credentials to log into SEMOSS. This will just be a local user, we recommend using a generic name such as Admin or your first name. 

![Final Page](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/finalPage.PNG)

Please note that the url here is slightly different than the one shared. This is using an older version of SEMOSS. 

Congratulations! You have everything up and running!

- **Go to Preferences > Java > Installed JREs.​**
- **Add your new Java 21 JDK** if it’s not already listed.​
- Set Java 21 as the default JRE​
  ![java update](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/java21.png)
- Click Apply and Close.​
- Allow SEMOSS to rebuild with the new JDK.​
- If your eclipse does not allow you to go up to java 21, then you must download the latest version of Eclipse. ​
- On your project build paths, verify that you see **“JRE System Library [zulu-21].”**
  - If not, click **“Add Library…”** and add JRE System Library and choose Java 21. Do this for both Monolith and SEMOSS
![java update](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/java21-1.png)
### Start Semoss Web
- Restart Eclipse (so that Eclipse loads the new Environment Variables we’ve added) 
- Select the Monolith project and make sure under **Project -> Properties -> Java Build Path**, maintain the following order under **Order and Export** tab. You will likely need to select JRE System Library and click **Top** to move it to the top.
![Java Build Path - Monolith](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/JavaBuildPath-Monolith.png)

- Apache Tomcat should not be in [unbound] state.  If so, then Select Apache to add to the classpath under Libraries tab.
- Once completed, click Apply and Close
- Within Eclipse, in the bottom Servers panel tab, right-click on the **Tomcat Server** and click **Publish**
  - After republishing, double check your modules path to ensure it accurately reflects what you named your Monolith Folder and re-save
    - E.g. “/Monolith” in the screenshot below
![Server Module](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/ServerModule.png)
  - Double click on the server to open the Overview folder. Find the Port tab and next to the "Tomcat admin port", change the port number to 8105.

- Next, click **Start**
  - A progress bar will appear at the bottom of Eclipse.
    
> **Note**
> If you have run into any errors that might prevent your server from starting correctly, verify your server Web Module Path is /Monolith

> In a command prompt navigate to C:/workspace/apache-tomcat 9.0.##/webapps/SemossWeb
- Run “pnpm run dev:client” in the command prompt/terminal to build the front end
- If done correctly, the last line should be something about "webpack compiled successfully"
  
> Once the previous step has completed, navigate to http://localhost:9090/SemossWeb/
 - If all everything is working properly this should redirect you to a set admin page
 - Type in the username you want to register with

> Then go back to http://localhost:9090/SemossWeb/ , and at the bottom of the page, hit register new user.
 - Fill out the required fields
 - Make sure the username you register is the same as the one typed into the admin page

> Once the new user is registered, you can sign in using the same information.
 
- Congratulations! You’re all set to start using SEMOSS!

![Semoss Started](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/SemossStarted.jpg)

> To ensure the backend is running correctly,
 - Navigate to http://localhost:9090/Monolith/api/config
 - A json file should appear here

> If there is error when you click on start due to Port 8005, please change it to 8006 or some other port
- Now open terminal in cfgai.ui folder and enter pnpm run dev:client to run the front end if its not already running
- Open Chrome and enter **http://localhost:9090/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/#/login**

// File: Advanced Installation\Troubleshooting

## Initial Install TroubleShooting
Check to see if this page loads http://localhost:9090/Monolith/api/config (should return JSON)

- ​If JSON doesn’t load, the back end isn't deploying… ​

  - If the console in Eclipse says "database is in use / locked“… ​

	- In the bottom panel area, on the Servers tab, double-click your server (Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost)​

    - In the new window that appears, switch from Overview to Modules tab (at the bottom of the opened window)​
    - Select the Monolith Web Module that appears in the table and click Edit on the right​

    - Make sure the Path accurately reflects what you named your Monolith Folder and the case (E.g., “/Monolith”)​

    - Uncheck auto reload​

    - Click Save in Eclipse​

    - Right click on your server, Clean, and Republish

​

- If JSON does load, the back end is deploying… ​
  - Navigate to the following path in your command prompt/terminal: C:/workspace/apache-tomcat 9.0.##/webapps/SemossWeb​

  - In the terminal type in: “pnpm install”​

  - Inside the same terminal type in: “pnpm run build” (may take ~10 min to run)​

  - Once finished, refresh, and try accessing http://localhost:9090/SemossWeb/ 
## BE Flow
Process starts with the Start Server step. Once the server is initiated, the flow progresses to the Web.xml configuration, which is crucial for setting up web application parameters. Following this, the process moves to the RDF_MAP, which likely involves mapping data structures or resources. Finally, the flow concludes with Social Props, indicating a step related to social properties or settings. This sequence ensures a structured setup and configuration process.
![Tomcat Server](../../static/img/BELocalInstall/ts1.png)

To reference the correct web.xml file in Eclipse, start by navigating to the server tab and double-clicking on your Tomcat server. Then, go to the "Modules" section, where you can see which BE files are currently deployed. For example, the vha-supply module is displayed in the list, helping you identify the specific deployment and its associated configuration files. This process ensures you are working with the correct web.xml for your application.

## Regarding SEMOSS Update

> When to Update
- If you need a stable build >> wait till you are told to update
- If you’ve had a bug >> update once your bug is fixed
- If you’re testing for the DEV team >> update hourly or by the day

### Updating Instructions
- First, update Monolith. In a command line, navigate to your Monolith folder 
  ```
  cd C:\workspace\Monolith
  ```
- Check if you have any local changes using `git status`. If you do have local changes, use the `git stash` command to save them.
![Semoss](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/GitStatusOutput.jpg)
Note that if you try to git pull without stashing your local changes, you will get a warning message:
![Semoss](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/GitPullConflict.jpg)
- Confirm that you are on the 'dev' branch. If not, run `git switch dev` to switch branches.
- Run `git pull` to pull in the latest changes from the dev branch.
  - You should see a list of the files which have been changed appear in the output.  Scroll through the output and check if any files are named "pom.xml".
  ![Semoss](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/GitPullOutput.jpg)
  - You may want to view these logs to know which specific files were changed in a revision, if a fix has come through for a bug you are tracking, or to see other changes in the build.
- If you wish to re-apply your local changes that you stashed earlier, run `git stash pop` 
![Semoss](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/GitStashPopOutput.jpg)
- Next, navigate to your Semoss folder (`cd C:\workspace\Semoss`) and repeat the above steps to pull the latest changes from the dev branch for the Semoss repo/folder.
- Next, navigate to your SemossWeb folder inside of Tomcat\webapps (`cd C:\workspace\apache-tomcat-X.X.XX\webapps\SemossWeb`, replacing the X's with your Tomcat version number) and repeat the above steps to pull the latest changes from the dev branch for the front-end repo/folder.
- Start Eclipse
- Refresh each project in Eclipse
- If there were pom.xml changes, Select both "Monolith" and "Semoss" and right click one of them and hold cursor over "Maven" and click "Update Project"
- Update both "Maven" Profiles by checking the box next to "Semoss" and "Monolith"
- Wait until workspace is completely built
- Start your Tomcat server

#### **Issues while Updating**
- The following section talks through some common occurrences that people may run into while updating:

**Conflicts in updating files**
- Sometimes you will have conflicts when you update. Conflicts happen when you have modified **and staged** a file on your computer that someone else also modified.
- When this happens, the output of your `git stash pop` command may look like this: 
![Semoss](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/GitStashPopConflict.jpg)
Note that the paths of the conflicted files that need to be manually resolved are displayed in the output!
- To fix this, open a file which is conflicted in VSCode. 
- View each of the sections labeled `>>>>>> Incoming changes` and `>>>>>> Current changes`, and edit the file to select which changes you want.
![Semoss](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/ResolveConflict.jpg)
	- If it is not a database file and you have not intentionally edited the file, use **Accept incoming change** in VSCode to override your local changes with the new changes from the Git repository. 
	- If it is a database file, select **Accept current change** in VSCode to maintain your database values.
	- If you have intentionally edited the file, you can manually update the file to combine your changes with the incoming ones.
- Once you have resolved all the conflicts in the file, save the changes in your text editor (Hint: double check to make sure there are no leftover ">>>>>>" or "======" symbols in the file). 
- Then, repeat this process for each conflicted file.

**Maven Dependency Issues**
- If Tomcat publishing fails with errors related to “The system cannot find the [.m2] file specified”, double check that you do not have any pre-installed security applications causing a firewall issue with Maven
- You will need to uninstall any security applications like Symantec
- To fix this, contact Deloitte IT via chat/phone in **MyTechnology** to suspend the service (this may take a day or two)
	- Open a ticket with IT and request for Symantec to be suspended for an installation through maven/eclipse
	- Once the IT personnel confirms Symantec has been disabled, they may prompt you confirm by doing steps 3-4
	- Verify Symantec is disabled: click the up caret in the bottom right corner of your desktop (right side of task bar) to reveal background application. Double-click on the yellow cloud with a green shield on it (this shows you security status with Symantec)
	- Inspect if Symantec has been suspended; the IT personnel will usually give you a window of time it will be disabled, or they will ask you to message them back immediately when you no longer need it suspended. (This will depend on the IT staff)
- Then in Eclipse, follow steps in slide 87, refresh your code, and clean your projects

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick9.png)


**If Maven doesn't download the dependencies correctly during your initial install**
- When you open the Problems view/tab (Window --> Show View --> Other --> Search Problems --> Select and Open), if any of the problems are categorized as ‘Maven Dependencies’ in the Type column (last column), then,
	- Download http://test.semoss.org/download/repository.zip
	- Close eclipse
	- Go to your .m2 folder in ‘C:\Users\USERNAME\.m2’
	- Delete the repository folder
	- Unzip the new repository folder in the zip you just downloaded in Step 1 and wait for it to finish
	- Make sure the repository folder is on the same level as the settings.xml file in the .m2 folder
	- Open eclipse
	- Select both Semoss and Monolith and right click --> Maven --> Update Project
	- Check Force Update
	- Press OK
	- Once this finishes, it should get rid of the ‘Maven Dependencies’ errors in the Problems tab

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick10.png)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick11.png)
  
  **Errors in Eclipse projects**
- Sometimes you will see a red ! or X on your Semoss or Monolith projects within eclipse. This means that there is an error somewhere in your code.
- Generally, this happens because the project needs to be refreshed or cleaned in eclipse. Try Updating Maven and cleaning your projects first.

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick12.png)


- After you update you should follow these steps within Eclipse in order to ensure your Semoss and Monolith projects are fully operational,
	- Update Maven
	- You usually only need to do this when the pom.xml is updated, which you can check during the [`git pull` update process](#regarding-semoss-update).
	- Right click on your Semoss and Monolith projects in the left hand panel of Eclipse and click Maven Update Project
	- Refresh your code
	- Right click on your Semoss and Monolith projects in the left hand panel of Eclipse and click Refresh to do this before starting SEMOSS
	- Clean your projects
	- From the top menu in Eclipse, select Project  Clean. Then select all your projects to clean.
	- Clean the Tomcat working directory
	- From the Java window, navigate to the Servers tab in the bottom section. Right click on Tomcat Server and select Clean.

- After you update you should follow these steps in order to ensure your front end changes take effect in Chrome
	- Empty Cache and Hard Reload: In Google Chrome, click F12. Then right click on the refresh button in the browser and select “Empty Cache and Hard Reload”

**If things go Wrong:**
- Here are a few important files to double check and make sure your paths are correct (http, port, and file paths):
	- RDF_MAP.prop (Semoss)
	- Web.xml (Monolith\WebContent\WEB-INF)
	- Config.js files in core, embed, and playsheet (SemossWeb)
	- Server.xml (Servers\Tomcat Server)

- Check your Monolith Build Path (it’s Users\Your username\workspace\Semoss\src) and the folder name is “Semosssrc”)
- If the path is incorrect, change it, click “Finish”. possible that the build path in Monolith pointing to Semoss has changed. To check this:
	- In Eclipse, right click on Monolith project and choose Build Path > Configure Build Path
	- Select Monolith/Semosssrc and choose “Edit” on the right-hand side
	- Make sure that the linked folder location is pointing to your Semoss src folder (probably C:\Us
	- If there are multiple Semosssrc links, remove all but the necessary one. Click “Finish”
	- Update, clean and refresh project
  
**Environment Variables**
- If your projects still have errors, you may need to delete your pom.xml file (Semoss) and [update again by performing `git pull`](#regarding-semoss-update).
- If you run into an issue in Eclipse that says it cannot find Local Master or Security:
	- Turn off Server
	- Delete databaseNewMaster.mv.db (C:\workspace\Semoss\db\LocalMasterDatabase) or database.mv.db (..\workspace\Semoss\db\security)
	- [Update Semoss](#regarding-semoss-update)
	- Restart Server

**Summary of If Things Go Wrong**
- Refresh your code
- Clean your projects
- Clean the Tomcat working directory
- Delete the databaseNewMaster.mv.db out of the Local Master Database folder
- Clear your cache
- Perform a hard refresh
- Restart your eclipse
- Restart your computer
- Talk to the dev team

**Eclipse won't open**
- If your Eclipse won’t open, it’s likely that your Java updated automatically by a Deloitte update.

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick13.png)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick14.png)

- To begin the fix, download the latest matching 64 bit JDK file from this website (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html)
	- Generally you want the Java SE 8uXXX version
- Navigate to this path:  C:\Programs Files\Java, and you should see a jdk and jre file
- Click within the JDK file and copy the file path at the top (ex. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_131)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick15.png)

- Go to the start menu and type in “Edit the system environment variables”
- Click “Environment Variables” at the bottom
- In the bottom of the “System Variables” pane, look for  JDK_HOME, JRE_HOME, and PATH—these are the variables that you will edit

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick16.png)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick17.png)


**Java Errors**
- Error: Cannot find the class file for javax.crypto.SecreKey
- Do the following to the Semoss build path:
	- Right click on Semoss
	- Under Build Path Select Configure Build Path
	- Click the Libraries tab
	- Select Add External JARs...
	- Add the jce.jar and the jsse.jar files located in your C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_281\lib
	- Apply
 
![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick18.png)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick19.png)
  
	 - In the Order and Export tab make sure the JRE System library is at the top and the jce.jar and jsse.jar are directly below
	- Check the jce.jar and jsse.jar boxes so that Monolith will inherit
	- You may need to go through the Refresh steps
 
![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick20.jpg)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick21.png)

- Edit JAVA_HOME variable with the path you copied before

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick22.png)

- Edit JRE_HOME with the path you copied before + \jre

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick23.png)

- Ensure the PATH variable uses your JAVA_HOME instead of being hardcoded
- Ensure your pom.xml does not contain a hardcoded java path

**Adding New Databases**
- The server should be off when adding new databases to Semoss
- Every database should also have a corresponding .smss file within the db folder.
- Copy and paste the folder and .smss file for the database into your Semoss/db folder
- Add the following line to the .smss file of the database you are adding if it is replacing one there before using the same name: RELOAD_INSIGHTS true
- If insights are not showing up after uploading a new database, try the following steps:
- In Insight Cache folder (Semoss) delete all files that are not called CSV_Insights
- Delete the databaseNewMaster.mv.db out of the Local Master Database folder and [update Semoss](#regarding-semoss-update)
- Go to Eclipse, clean the projects, run, and hard refresh in Chrome

**Helpful Tips**

**Server Configuration**
- If you are getting an error related to connection aborted, this is likely because your port is already in use. Deloitte has started using/blocking port 8080, so you will need to perform the following steps to correct,

	server.xml
	- Open your Windows File Explorer and navigate to the following path: C:\workspace\apache-tomcat-9.0.30\conf
	- Right click on server.xml and Open With Notepad++
	- Find the line that says \<Connector and the port number (should be around line 63)
	- Change the port to 9090
	- Save and close the file

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick24.png)

	Eclipse
	- Restart Eclipse
	- In the bottom panel area, on the Servers tab, double-click your new server (Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost).
	- Under Ports, ensure the Port Number matches the port number you defined in your server.xml (likely 9090)
	- Save the file with changes

	Browser
	- Open Chrome and enter http://localhost:9090/SemossWeb/
	- “SemossWeb” = the name of your folder during the initial repository creation.
	- Notice the new port number

- If you are still having issues after going through these steps, check your server configuration. Double click on your server in the Servers tab to view the settings.
	Server Locations
	- “Use Tomcat Installation” should be checked
	
	Ports
	- Check that HTTP/1.1 points to the correct port number (probably 9090 or 443)
	
	Modules
	- “Path” and “Document Base” should have the same name as your Monolith project (ex. Monolith)

 **Server In Use**
- If you are getting a message that your server port is already in use, follow these steps:
- Close Eclipse
- Open Command prompt as an Administrator
- Run the command: `netstat -ano | findstr :<9090>`
- Replace `<9090>` with the port number that is in use if it is different
- The output will specify the process identifier that is running (numbers to the right of ‘LISTENING’)
- Run the command: `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`
- Replace `<PID>` with the process identifier in step 4
- Reopen Eclipse as an Administrator and start the server

**Tomcat Error**
- If you see this error:​ "The specified JRE installation does not exist"​
- when starting Tomcat, it means Tomcat is still set to use another JDK. Update it as follows: 
- In the Servers panel, double-click on Tomcat v9.0 Server at localhost to open the Server Overview.​
- Under General Information, find Runtime Environment and click its link (such as Apache Tomcat v9.0).​
- In the window that opens, select your new Java 21 JRE in the "JRE" dropdown.​
- Click Finish, then save (Ctrl+S).
![Tomcat Error](<../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/tomcat error.png>)

**Missing R Packages**
- Open the R console
- Run install.packages("pacman")
- Run this script: https://github.com/SEMOSS/docker-r-packages/blob/R4.1.2-debian11/Packages.R

**Eclipse Network Problem**
- Disconnect from the Deloitte VPN
- Reinstall Eclipse from [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2020-06/r)

![SEMOSS](../../static/img/SemossDevInstallation/Trick25.png)

**MVN not recognized as an internal or external command**
- Run echo %PATH% in the cmd to find the maven path​
- Verify the path exists in your file explorer and matches the MVN environment variable

// File: Advanced Installation\Deploying a Private Server\Sandbox Deployment

## Infrastructure Requirements

The minimum requirements include 32 GB of RAM, 8 CPU cores, and a 200 GB disk size. Additionally, GPU support is needed with 2 nodes, each having a 200 GB disk.
We aim to have both CPU and GPUs available for each of the nodes.

## Deploy AI server using a Docker container (Non-Prod)  

This talks about how you can test the exiting docker image in the sandbox. We would need couple of scripts in order to run the docker image in a VM and perform testing.

### Prerequisites  

#### Docker Login

Before you begin, ensure that you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install Docker from the official website: [Docker - Get Started](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).  

* Obtain Docker Registry Credentials
* Login into https://docker.cfg.deloitte.com/
* Copy the CLI secret from User Profile
* Log in to the Docker Registry and obtain CLI secret. Use the following command to log in to your Docker registry `docker login docker.cfg.deloitte.com`

###  Docker Deployment Scripts

You can find the [deployment scripts](https://repo.semoss.org/gen-ai/cfgai-deployment/-/tree/master/dev-grade-deployment) here.

1. Create a configuration file (e.g., config.env) that defines the common variables. It might look like this: 

**config.env**
````
currDir="/path/to/your/directory"
dockerImage=docker.cfg.deloitte.com/genai/genai-server:4.3.0-SNAPSHOT-dev-latest
````
* Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path you want to use

2. Run the init.sh script: This script will pull the Docker image, create a container, copy its contents to the specified local directory, and  perform cleanup.

**init.sh**  
````
 #!/bin/bash
 source /path/to/config.env
 mkdir -p $currDir
 docker pull $dockerImage
 docker run -itd --name semosstmp $dockerImage bash
 docker cp semosstmp:/opt/semosshome $currDir
 docker kill semosstmp
 docker rm semosstmp
````
* **/opt/semosshome:** This directory serves as the central hub for storing various components, including databases, model connections,  and projects. It acts as the primary location for organizing and managing your system's key elements.
* Replace "/path/to/config.env" with the actual path to your config.env file.

3. Automates the setup of an AI server by sourcing configuration, running a Docker container with volume mapping and port forwarding:

**startSEMOSS.sh**
````
#!/bin/bash
 source /path/to/config.env
 docker run -itd --name ai-server \
 -v $currDir/semosshome:/opt/semosshome \
 -p 8080:8080 $dockerImage
````
* Replace "/path/to/config.env" with the actual path to your config.env file.
* If you intend to run the server in a Docker container with GPU support, use the --gpus flag to specify GPU devices. You can either provide the GPU IDs or use 'all' to utilize all available GPUs. Example:`docker run --gpus all -d your_image_name`

4. Script to stop and remove a Docker container named "ai-server".

**stopSEMOSS.sh**
````
#!/bin/bash
 docker kill ai-server
 docker rm ai-server
````

5. Execute the below script to perform a restart.

**restartSEMOSS.sh**
````
 #!/bin/bash
 /path/to/your/directory/stopSEMOSS.sh
 /path/to/your/directory/startSEMOSS.sh
````
* Replace "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path.

#### Optional  
Systemd is entirely optional element to start AI server.  

6. Systemd service configuration for an AI server.

**ai.service**
````
 [Unit]
 Description=Health check script
 After=network.target

 [Service]
 User=root
 WorkingDirectory=/path/to/your/directory
 ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/directory/startHealthCheck.py

 [Install]
 WantedBy=multi-user.target
````
* Copy the startHealthCheck.py from cfg-ai-server-scripts folder.
* Replace WorkingDirectory "/path/to/your/directory" with the actual path.
* Provide absolute path to the startHealthCheck.py script.
* As a psuedo user, copy the contents of this file to the following location: "/lib/systemd/system/service".

* To manage the AI server using systemd, use the following systemctl commands:

``` bash 
 # Reload the AI server service after making changes to the systemd service file
 sudo systemctl daemon-reload 

 # Enable the AI server service to start on boot
 sudo systemctl enable ai.service 

 # Start the AI server service
 sudo systemctl start ai.service 

 # Stop the AI server service
 sudo systemctl stop ai.service 

 # Check the status of the AI server service
 sudo systemctl status ai.service 
 ```

7. Locate the script where the *run_restart_script()* function is defined.

8. Look for the run_restart_script function in your script. It should resemble the following:

````
def run_restart_script():
    # replace this with the path to your restart script
    subprocess.call(["/path/to/your/directory/restartSEMOSS.sh"])
````

9. Update the path in the subprocess.call line to point to the correct location of your restartSEMOSS script.

### Deployment.yaml

The **deployment.yaml** file is used to define and configure a Kubernetes Deployment. A Deployment is responsible for managing a set of identical Pods and ensuring their availability and scalability.
* apiVersion: specifies the Kubernetes API version.
* kind: Defines the resource type.
* metadata: Provides information about the resource.
* labels : Key-value pairs for identification.
* replicas: Specifies the number of identical Pods.
* volumes: In the specsection of a Kubernetes Deployment or Pod configuration, the volumes field defines the storage volumes that can be accessed by containers running within the Pod. Each volume can have various types depending on the storage requirement.
    * One type of volume is a secret volume, which is used to securely store sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or certificates. When defining a secret volume, you need to specify the secretName field which refers to the name of the Kubernetes Secret that holds the sensitive data.
    * Here's an example of how to define a secret volume with a secretName and defaultMode:
````
volumes:
    - name: secret
        secret:
            secretName: secret
            defaultMode: 256
            optional: false
````
* Within a Pod's spec section, the containers field is an array that defines one or more containers to be run within the Pod. Each container within the array has its own configuration, including the Docker image to use, command-line arguments (args), and network connectivity configuration (ports).
    * The args field within a container definition allows you to specify the command-line arguments to be passed to the container's entrypoint. These arguments are typically used to customize the behavior of the containerized application. The args field is an array of strings, where each element of the array represents an individual argument.
    * Here's an example of how to define args within a container:
````
containers:
- name: my-container
image: my-image:latest
args:
  - --arg1=value1
  - --arg2=value2
````

* The ports field within a container definition is used to define the network connectivity configuration for the container. It specifies which port(s) the container will listen on and how those ports should be exposed externally.
    * In the above example, the container named my-container is using the my-image:latest` Docker image. It exposes port 8080 within the container and specifies that it uses the TCP protocol.

* The env field is an array of key-value pairs, where each pair consists of a name and value field. The name field represents the name of the environment variable, and the value field holds the corresponding value. In the deployment that we have provided we have defined 5 different databases and we have provided one example below:

````
env:
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_DRIVER
    value: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_RDBMS_TYPE
    value: SQL_SERVER
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_USERNAME
    value: username
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_PASSWORD
    value: passwd
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_SCHEMA
    value: dbo
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_DATABASE
    value: cfg_ai_sec
- name: CUSTOM_SECURITY_CONNECTION_URL
    value: >-
    jdbc:sqlserver://10.10.10.10:443;databaseName=cfg_ai_sec;encrypt=true;trustServerCertificate=true;
- name: MS_AUTHORITY
    value: >-
    https://login.microsoftonline.com/36da45f1-dd2c-4d1f-af13-5abe46b99921/
- name: MS_CLIENT_ID
    value: client_id
- name: MS_REDIRECT
    value: >-
    https://<my-dns>/cfg-ai-demo/Monolith/api/auth/login/ms
- name: MS_SECRET_KEY
    value: secret_key
- name: MS_TENANT
    value: deloitte.onmicrosoft.com
````
      
* If you have a different endpoint for SSO, you would need to modify the value of the SSO_ENDPOINT environment variable accordingly. Additionally, if the authentication credentials for this different endpoint are distinct from the previous configuration, you would need to provide the appropriate credentials to authenticate with that endpoint.

* Resources: In Kubernetes, CPU, ephemeral-storage, memory, and GPU are resources used to allocate and manage compute resources for containers in a cluster.

* The volumeMounts field is part of a container definition within a Pod specification. It is an array of objects where each object represents a volume mount. Each volume mount object consists of the following fields:
      * name: The name of the volume to mount. This should match the name field of the corresponding volume defined in the Pod's volumes field.
     * mountPath: The directory or file path within the container's file system where the volume should be mounted.
````
  volumeMounts:
  - name: bucketsecret
    mountPath: /mnt/key
````

* In the above example, It mounts a volume named bucketsecret at the path /mnt/key within the container's file system. This allows the container to read from and write to files stored in the data-volume volume.

* Recreate indicates that when an update is required, the existing pods will be terminated and new pods will be created from the updated deployment.
````
strategy:
    type: Recreate
revisionHistoryLimit: 10
progressDeadlineSeconds: 600
````

* evisionHistoryLimit: 10 specifies that a maximum of 10 previous revisions of the deployment will be stored in the revision history.
* progressDeadlineSeconds: 600 sets the maximum amount of time (in seconds) that the deployment can take to progress during an update. If the progress exceeds this deadline, the deployment will be considered as failed.
* This configuration ensures that the deployment uses the "Recreate" strategy, keeps a revision history of up to 10 revisions, and has a progress deadline of 600 seconds.

### Service.yaml
The service.yaml file is used to define and configure a Kubernetes Service. A Service provides stable network access to a set of Pods, allowing other resources within or outside the cluster to communicate with them.

````
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: cfg-ai
    app.kubernetes.io/name: cfg-ai
  type: ClusterIP
  sessionAffinity: None
  ipFamilies:
    - IPv4
  ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack
  internalTrafficPolicy: Cluster
````

In the given YAML configuration for a Kubernetes Service, the spec field defines the desired state of the Service.
   * ports section specifies the port configuration for the Service. In this example, it defines a single port with TCP protocol, where both the port and targetPort are set to 8080.
   * selector field is used to select the Pods that the Service will route traffic to. In this case, the Service selects Pods with the labels app.kubernetes.io/instance: cfg-ai and app.kubernetes.io/name: cfg-ai.
   * type: ClusterIP indicates that the Service is of type ClusterIP, which means it is only accessible within the cluster.
   * sessionAffinity: None specifies that the Service does not perform session affinity (client IP stickiness).
   * ipFamilies section specifies the IP families supported by the Service. In this case, it supports only IPv4.
   * ipFamilyPolicy: SingleStack indicates that the Service only supports a single IP family (IPv4).
   * internalTrafficPolicy: Cluster specifies that the Service only receives traffic from within the cluster.
   * This configuration sets up a Kubernetes Service with a single TCP port 8080, routing traffic to Pods with specific labels. The Service is of type ClusterIP, supports only IPv4, does not perform session affinity, and receives traffic only from within the cluster.


### Ingress.yaml
The ingress.yaml file is used to configure an Ingress resource in Kubernetes. Ingress provides external access to services within a cluster by routing incoming traffic to the appropriate service based on rules defined in the Ingress resource.

**Example 1:** Ingress with Base Path \
This configuration sets up an ingress rule for the base path / directing traffic to the specified service.
````
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - workshop.cfg.deloitte.com
      secretName: workshop-tls
  rules:
    - host: workshop.cfg.deloitte.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: cfg-ai
                port:
                  number: 8080
````

**Example 2:** Ingress with sub-Path /cfg-ai/(.*)

This configuration establishes an ingress rule for the sub-path /cfg-ai/(.*) directing traffic to a different service with a specific port. Adjust the service names, ports, and domain according to your specific setup. It also includes a rewrite annotation for handling the sub-path.
````
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress-with-subpath
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$1
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  tls:
    - hosts:
        - workshop.cfg.deloitte.com
      secretName: workshop-tls
  rules:
    - host: workshop.cfg.deloitte.com
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /cfg-ai/(.*)
            pathType: ImplementationSpecific
            backend:
              service:
                name: cfg-ai
                port:
                  number: 8080
````

In the given YAML configuration for an Ingress resource in Kubernetes, the spec field defines the desired state of the Ingress.
   * ingressClassName: nginx specifies the class name of the Ingress controller that should handle this Ingress resource.
   * tls section defines the TLS configuration for the Ingress. In this case, it specifies that the host workshop.cfg.deloitte.com should be secured using the TLS certificate stored in the Secret named workshop-tls.
   * rules section defines the routing rules for the Ingress. In this example, there is a single rule for the host workshop.cfg.deloitte.com. Requests matching the specified path /cfg-ai/(.*) will be forwarded to the backend service named cfg-ai on port 8080.
   * pathType: ImplementationSpecific indicates that the path matching behavior is specific to the Ingress controller implementation.
   * This configuration sets up an Ingress resource that uses the nginx Ingress controller, secures the workshop.cfg.deloitte.com host with TLS using the workshop-tls Secret, and forwards requests to the cfg-ai service on port 8080 for the specified path.

# Introduction to Apps 

### What is an App?

In SEMOSS, an app is a customizable GenAI solution built on a low-code platform with configurable components. Advanced users can upload web-based applications. These apps are accessible and modifiable through the App Library.

### Why Create an App?

Developing an app on the SEMOSS platform offers several benefits:

- **Customization and Flexibility**: Tailor apps to meet specific business needs, addressing unique challenges and requirements effectively.
- **Efficiency and Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks and streamline workflows, increasing productivity and reducing manual effort.
- **Data Integration**: Integrate SEMOSS apps with various data sources for comprehensive data analysis and visualization, supporting better decision-making.
- **Scalability**: Scale apps with the organization's growth, accommodating increasing data volumes and user demands.
- **Innovation**: Foster innovation by creating new solutions that leverage advanced analytics, AI, and machine learning capabilities.
- **Competitive Advantage**: Gain a competitive edge with unique functionalities that differentiate the organization from competitors.
- **User Experience**: Enhance user satisfaction and engagement with intuitive interfaces and interactive features.

### Who can develop an App?

App development on the SEMOSS platform can involve various stakeholders, including:

- **Data Scientists and Analysts**: Develop apps for advanced data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.
- **Software Developers**: Create and customize apps using programming skills to build complex functionalities and integrations.
- **Business Analysts**: Design apps to address specific business requirements and improve operational efficiency.
- **IT Professionals**: Develop and maintain apps to ensure they meet technical standards and integrate seamlessly with existing systems.

### SEMOSS App Options

![App Library Home](../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/AppBuildingOptionsNew.png)

In SEMOSS, there are three different ways to create apps: Agent Builder, Drag and Drop, and Code. Here’s a brief overview of each method and the type of user who might prefer it:

- **Construct an agent**: A guided tool that helps users create apps through prompting. Users can create apps by specifying their requirements and edit the app using Drag and Drop System Components. Ideal for business users who may not have technical skills but need to create apps quickly and easily. It allows them to focus on business logic and requirements without worrying about the underlying code.
- **Drag and Drop**: This method allows users to create apps by dragging and dropping various components (like charts, tables, and forms) onto a canvas. It provides a visual way to build and configure apps. Suitable for admins who need to customize and manage apps without deep coding knowledge. It offers a balance between ease of use and flexibility, enabling them to design functional and visually appealing apps.
- **Code**: This method involves writing code to create and customize apps. It offers the highest level of flexibility and control, allowing for complex and highly customized solutions. Best for developers who have the technical expertise to write code. It allows them to leverage their programming skills to create sophisticated and tailored applications that meet specific business needs.

| Method        | Description                                                | Benefits                                               
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Construct an agent | Guided tool that helps users create apps by prompting      | Ideal for business users who need to create apps quickly and easily |
| Drag and Drop | Create apps by dragging and dropping components onto a canvas | Suitable for admins who need to customize and manage apps |
| Code          | Writing code to create and customize apps                  | Best for developers who have the technical expertise to write code |

Each method caters to different user skill levels and needs, ensuring that SEMOSS can be effectively used by a wide range of professionals within an organization. We will go over each Create New App method in detail.

# Using Construct an agent(Agent Builder) to Create a New App

Agent Builder is a Drag and Drop feature in SEMOSS designed for developing applications where users can input data and receive corresponding outputs. Agent Builder simplifies UI creation by requiring only a prompt to define the input types the user will provide and expected outputs of the app.

Initially, we will create a prompt that specifies the types of inputs users will provide and the expected outputs. Once this initial UI is generated, the Agent Builder app functions just like any other Drag and Drop app in SEMOSS. Let's understand the process to develop an app via Construct an agent.

<ReactPlayer controls url={AgentBuilderDemo} />

To use Agent Builder, first click on **Create New App** button on the top right corner of your SEMOSS home page and then click on **Get Started** on the Construct an agent tab.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB14.png)

## Create a Prompt

### Prompt Details

In this section, we give a name to our prompt. Also, we will select a model (LLM) through which the prompt will run to provide the output based on user input.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB15.png)

### Define the Prompt

In the "Prompt Context" section, we will write the actual prompt that defines the input options for the user and outlines the app's UI. To write a prompt, imagine you are talking to the app as if it were a living being and explain its role. For instance, if you are creating an itinerary planner app, you might say, *"Suppose you are a travel agent."* This sets the context for the app's role.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB3.png)

### Including User Inputs and Expected Output

We will also include the inputs the user will provide and the expected output the app should present. For example, a sample prompt for a travel guide app could be:

*"Suppose you are a travel agent. The user will provide the destination, number of days of travel, and their travel pace preference (slow or fast). Prepare an itinerary for them."*

In this example, we have:
	1. Told the app about its role.
	2. Mentioned the inputs the user will provide.
	3. Specified the expected output.

### Define the Input Parameter

The inputs that the user decides are called input parameters. We need to inform the app about these input parameters, which the user will provide data for. To do this, include the input parameters inside double curly brackets \{\{ \}\}. This way, the app knows that these are the input parameters provided by the user. Our sample prompt will be updated to: 

*"Suppose you are a travel agent. The user will provide the \{\{destination\}\}, \{\{number of days\}\} of travel, and their \{\{travel pace\}\} preference (slow or fast). Prepare an itinerary for them."*

You can also set input parameters under the 'Set Inputs' section after creating the prompt. Click on the word you want to create as an input parameter.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB16.png)

### Test Prompt

After you define your input and select your model (LLM), you can test your prompt against the LLM and decide if the model fits your app's needs.

### Define Input Types

In this section, you can define the type of the input parameter you have selected. You can choose between any of the options in the dropdown that best suits the input needed.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB17.png)

### Set Constraints

In this last section before previewing your prompt, you can set constraints for the output. Examples include limiting responses to a certain number of words, specifying whether the output should be in bullet points or not, etc..

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB18.png)

### Preview Prompt

Click on the "Preview" button to save your settings. You will be directed to the preview of the prompt.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB19.png)

Click on Create App to complete creating the app. You will be directed to the UI page where you will be able to see the input parameters that you created. Once you enter inputs for these prompts, the App will run through the model and provide an output.

## Post Initial App Development

### Editing the prompt

It is possible to edit the original prompt you have created. To do this, go to your app in the App Library and click on **Edit** in the top right corner.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB20.png)

Now go to the Data tab and click on Notebooks tab and then on **Prompt Query**. Here, inside the query, encapsultaed by the double quotes, we can edit the original prompt. Save the changes so it reflects in the UI.

![AB](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB21.png)

### Editing the UI tab or Data tab

Using Construct an agent, by providing a prompt, we can develop the entire app. This automatically sets up the UI and creates the required queries (notebooks) and variables in the Data tab. However, you can still edit the UI by adding or removing blocks, or by adding more queries (notebooks) and creating variables. This process mimics the Drag and Drop app.

If we want to edit the **UI tab**, by adding different blocks like HTML, Iframe, or an Image, you can follow the steps mentioned in the documentation of the Drag and Drop app. Please click on the link below for detailed instructions:
*    [Edit the UI tab](./No%20Code%20App%20Creation%20by%20Drag%20and%20Drop.mdx#Design)

If we want to edit the **Data tab** by adding more queries or variables, it is recommended to delete this app and use the Drag and Drop feature to create a new app. Please refer to the documentation in the link below for guidance:
*    [Edit the Data tab](./No%20Code%20App%20Creation%20by%20Drag%20and%20Drop.mdx#using-the-notebook-tab)

# Drag and Drop Blocks to Build UI for your new App

To create a user interface (UI) for a new app, follow these steps:
1. **Drag and Drop Components**: Use the drag-and-drop feature to place UI components (like buttons, text boxes, and images) onto the app's design area.
2. **Customize Design**: Adjust the placement and appearance of these components to match your design requirements.
3. **Use Building Blocks**: Utilize the available building blocks (pre-made UI elements) to construct the app's layout.
4. **Add Data**: Link the UI components to data sources or input fields to add data to the app.

<ReactPlayer controls url={IntroToDragAndDrop} />

To begin creating an app, click on **Create New App**. Then, on the **Drag and Drop** tile, click on **Get Started**.

![App Library Home](../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/AppBuildingOptionsNew.png)

Next, you will need to name your new app and can optionally provide a description of what your app’s purpose is, too. After entering the name, you will be directed to a page where you can start building the user interface. On the left side of this page, you will see tabs labeled **Blocks**, **Layers**, **Variables**, **Files**, and **Notebooks**.

1. **Blocks**: These blocks allow users to create and customize visualizations and data transformations by dragging and dropping different components. They are used to build workflows and analytical processes without the need for extensive coding.

2. **Layers**: The Layers panel is used to manage different layers of data and visualizations. Layers can be thought of as different views or aspects of the data that can be overlaid to create complex visualizations. This is particularly useful in geospatial analysis or when combining multiple data sources.

3. **Variables**: This panel is used to manage variables within SEMOSS. Variables can store data, intermediate results, or parameters that can be reused across different parts of a project. They help in making the analysis dynamic and flexible.

4. **Files**: The Files panel is where users can upload, manage, and organize their data files. These files can include datasets, scripts, or any other relevant documents. Users can import data from various sources and formats.

5. **Notebooks**: In this section, you can use Notebooks to write and run code, which helps in developing and testing scripts interactively.

Click on the **Blocks** tab. Here, you will find a variety of blocks available for constructing your app's user interface. Once an element is placed on the page, you can edit the system component by adjusting settings by clicking Block Settings tab; which opens a panel of configuration options.

The **Block Settings** tab is located in the panel to the far right. The Block Settings tab is used to configure and customize the behavior and appearance of the System Components. Here's a simple breakdown of what you can typically do in the Block Settings tab:

1. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - You can change various settings related to how the block functions. For example, you can use variables to dynamically change parameters.

2. **Input and Output Configuration**:
   - This allows you to specify what data goes into the block and what data comes out. You can edit text values or set variables for a dynamic approach.

3. **Styling and Appearance**:
   - You can customize the look of your visualizations. This might include changing colors, alignments, labels, and other visual elements to make your charts and graphs more readable and visually appealing.

Detailed information on how to use each System Component can be found
[here](../documentation/category/system-components).

## Design

### Element

The different types of blocks we can add here are mentioned below,

#### Divider
By adding a Divider you can separate your content with a line. Click on the Block Settings (top right) to enter the divider's details.

![Divider](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDdivider.png)

Variant - Here you can specify whether you want a full width line (choose option 'Full Width' for this), a shorter line centered at the centre (option 'Middle'), or a shorter line aligned to the right (Inset).
Orientation - Choose whether you want a horizontal divider line or a vertical divider line. If you choose vertical line, it will automatically be right aligned.
Divider Text - You can even add a text to your divider line. For this, enter your text in the Divider text and click on the 'Show Text' toggle to switch it to 'on'.
Text Alignment - You can select the alignment of the text to Centre, Left, or Right.
Light Variant - Select this toggle for a lighter colour tone of the divider line
Flex Item - By selecting this toggle, your divider line will be visible only if it is a horizontal line.

Dimensions-
Mention the specifications of your divider line. If its a horizontal line mention its width and if its vertical line mention its height. Max. width and height can be mentioned to put a cap to the dimensions.

#### HTML
HTML is added to the App for inclusion of a web page. We can either generate HTML page using AI or can write a customized HTML code.

You can write your own code in the area highlighted in the image below.

![HTML](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDhtml.png)

To use AI to generate your code, write a prompt under the AI Generator, select an LLM, and click on Generate.


#### Icon
You can even add an Icon to your App page. Drag and Drop the Icon block and in the Block Settings choose any icon you may like to add. Add details like colour and dimensions (width and height) for your icon.


#### IFrame
**IFrame** block can be used when we want to add a web page into the App interface. Mention the link of the webpage and give it a title. Add various specifications of the frame like its height and width, margin (space around the element) and padding (space inside the element), and its border size, colour, and style.

#### Image
We can add images using the **Image block**. After adding an Image block (by drag and drop), we can click on **Block Settings tab** (on the left side of the page) and put url of the image we want to insert along with also mentioning its position in the block and setting the dimension details.


The **IFrame** block can be used when we want to add a web page into the App interface. This is especially useful for embedding external content such as a live data dashboard, video, or an external form or survey. Embedding these elements provides additional functionality without requiring users to navigate away from the app.

We can also add images using the **Image** block to enhance visual communication in our app. For instance, we might use the Image block to insert a company logo or instructional graphics to make the content easier to understand. After adding an Image block (by drag and drop), we can click on the **Block Settings** tab and enter the url of the image we want to insert along with also mentioning its position in the block and setting the dimension details.

### Input

This category allows us to add interactive elements to our app, enabling users to enter or select information as part of their experience. By using input blocks, we can capture feedback, personalize content, and guide user decisions. 

We can choose from several input options, including **Audio Player**, **Button**, **Checkbox**, **Select**, **Input**, **Toggle Button**, or **Upload**. 

- **Audio Player**: We use the Audio Player when we want to share voice-based content directly in the app. This can be useful for playing back instructions or narrated summaries. This option lets us embed audio clips directly into the App.

- **Button**: We add a button when we want users to trigger an action or generate an output. For example, we might add a “Submit” button to complete a form. 

- **Checkbox**: Checkboxes allow us to easily select or unselect options, which is helpful for toggling features or preferences. This is useful when we want others to agree to terms or subscribe to updates.

- **Select**: The Select block provides a dropdown menu, letting users choose one or more items from a list of predefined options. This is ideal for forms or filters. We can use the Block Settings tab to customize these options and link them to data if needed.

- **Input**: The Input block is used when we want users to type in their own values instead of selecting from a list. This gives us flexibility in scenarios where responses are open-ended. This is useful for when we want users to type in their own response, such as names, comments, or any custom information that cannot be standardized ahead of time.

![Input](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDinput.png)

- **Toggle Button**: The Toggle Button is an on/off switch for a specific feature, setting, or rule in the App. For instance, we can use it to show or hide a component like a chart or image. It’s an easy way to control conditional behavior in the App.

- **Upload:** We use the Upload block when we want users to submit files directly into the app, such as a document, image, or spreadsheet.

These input blocks help us create user-friendly, interactive apps that support data collection, real-time actions, and tailored content. 

### Layout and Progress

This category enables us to build the UI layout using Containers and Query blocks, which help organize the structure and flow of the app interface. For example, when creating a user profile section, we might want to group a profile picture, username, and an “Edit” button together so they appear as a single, cohesive unit. This is where layout tools like the Container Block become essential. 

For example, a **Container Block** is used to group and arrange other blocks like Element, Input or Text in a clear and organized way. Using the Block Settings tab, we can customize the specifications of the container from Layout to Border.

![Layout](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDlayout.png)

The **Progress** block is used to visually display the status or completion level of any feature/element in the App, such as tracking progress through a multi-step form or a data submission process.

### Text

The Text category allows us to add various types of content to the page via Link, Logs, Markdown or Text blocks. You can include a **Link** block that directs users to another page or file. To add link details, click on Block Settings and select the Link block. **Logs** are embedded blocks used to track App performance and user activity over time. **Markdown** blocks support formatted text such as headers, bullet lists, bold or italicized words, and hyperlinks. These are useful for displaying structured content, like documentation or updates. If you just need to display plain text (e.g., instructions or descriptions), you can use a **Text** block. To customize the formatting or behavior, go to Block Settings, select the Text block and use the customization section.

![Text](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDtext.png)

The **Layers** tab on the left-hand side as shown below will list all the blocks that were selected to be layered in an App. For full documentation on the Block Settings for the Layers tab and Layers panel, click The Block Settings tab is located in the panel to the far right. The Block Settings tab is used to configure and customize the behavior and appearance of the System Components. Here's a simple breakdown of what you can typically do in the Block Settings tab:

1. **Adjust Parameters**:
   - You can change various settings related to how the block functions. For example, you can use variables to dynamically change parameters.

2. **Input and Output Configuration**:
   - This allows you to specify what data goes into the block and what data comes out. You can edit text values or set variables for a dynamic approach.

3. **Styling and Appearance**:
   - You can customize the look of your visualizations. This might include changing colors, alignments, labels, and other visual elements to make your charts and graphs more readable and visually appealing.

Detailed information on how to use each System Component can be found
[here](../How%20To/System%20Components/Layers%20Panel.md).

![Layers](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDlayers.png)

### Theme

Theme blocks can be used as parent blocks to assign a specific theme to the entire page. Thus, theme could be the first block we add to the UI and then all other blocks can be added inside the theme block.

![Theme](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DNDtheme.png)

As seen in the image above, we have added the button block inside the theme block. To make changes to the theme go to layers, select theme block and go to block settings (at the right side of the screen). Now you can give a colour theme to the button block, also decide what colour of text should it display.

Users with admin permissions are able to update the theme. For more detailed information on updating the theme database, reference this link 
 [here](../For%20Administrators/Modifying%20the%20Theme.mdx).

## Using the Notebook tab

In the **Notebook** tab, we can click the Create a Notebook icon. From here, we can assign the Notebook an identifier. In the Notebook cell, we can enter our code in Pixel, Python, or R. A user can query data, connect Notebook cells to large language models, and import data from databases that they have role-based permission to access. 

![Scripting Language](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB1.png)

It is important to understand the difference between a query and a query cell. A query, or notebook, consists of multiple query cells. A query can have multiple cells, and multiple queries (or notebooks) can be created in the Notebook tab. A query is generally a complete set of actions contributing to the operation of the app. For example, in a payment feature, entering payment details, hitting enter, and communicating with the bank server can together form a "Payment" query. Each action, such as entering payment details or hitting enter, represents a different cell within the query. 

Sometimes, the functions within these cells are required in other queries as well. For instance, communicating with a bank server may also be necessary for user authentication. Thus, another query, like "User Authentication," may use the "communicating with the bank server" query cell defined in the “Payment” query. This shows that cells from different queries or notebooks can be interconnected.

Under cells, we can choose either a **Code** cell, represented by a **\<\> cell**, or a **Import Data** cell, and then write code or a query to access SEMOSS resources as per app requirements.

![Multiple cells](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB2.png)

If we choose a Code cell, we can navigate to the SEMOSS resource (Model, Database, Storage, Vector Database, etc.) we want to connect with the app and click on the usage tab within the resource. We can copy the code based on the scripting language chosen for the cell and paste it into the Notebook query cell. This code can be modified or customized altogether.

![Model Usage](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB3.png)

In a Import Data cell, we can write a database query and select the Database from the list of accessible databases. 

![Database drop-down list](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB4.png)

The Import Data cell differs from the Code cell in how it represents data. Using a Import Data cell, we can get data in a tabular form (or Data Frame). For example, selecting the database and our desired rows and columns from any database (in this case **executive_orders_dev**) and running the cell will give tabular form below the cell. 

![Data Frame](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB5.png)

We can also transform data presented in the columns of the table using the **Transformation** option. Some possible transformations include converting lowercase to uppercase. To transform any column's data, click on Transformation and choose the type of transformation from the list.

![Transformation](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB6.png)

A new cell for the selected transformation will appear below, and in that cell, choose the Frame in which to transform data. Then, select the required details as per the chosen transformation type and run the query. The modified or updated data will then be displayed in the Frame, as shown in the screenshot below. 

![Transformation Uppercase](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/NB7.png)

### Creating and using variables

To connect the user interface with a created query, follow these steps:
- Click on the Variables tab.
- Click on the add (+) button on the left side of the panel.
- Define the variable by adding the necessary details as shown below.

![Create variables](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR1.png)

- Once the variables are defined, update your code by replacing any constants with the variables you just created, as shown in the screenshot.

![Input variables](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR2.png)

- Now your code is ready. Click on Run All to test it. If you encounter any errors, double-check that you have selected the correct programming language and that your variables are defined correctly.

![Connect Query ID with UI Block](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR3.png)

- In the example below, we are adding an ONCLICK action to a Button block. To do this, click on New Action on the right side under ONCLICK and enter the query type and query ID as shown in the example. This enables our Button block to execute queries.

![Link Query with Action Block](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR4.png)

- In this example, to connect a query that automatically runs when an App page is opened, select the page block that embeds all other blocks. Click on **New Action** on the right-hand side under **ON PAGE LOAD** and enter the query type and query ID as shown in the screenshot. You can add multiple queries to the page, and they will automatically run whenever someone opens the App page.

![Page Query](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR5.png)

- Click on **Settings** to set the accessibility of the App and to delete the App as shown below.

![Settings Icon](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR6.png)

- After making all the changes, you can **Preview** the App before saving and then **Save** it. You can also share the link of the App with other members or users as needed.

- Now, go into the **App Library** and click on the App you have created. You will see the UI of the App you have created as shown below.

![UI Built Application](../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/VAR7.png)

# Use pre-built templates

Pre-built templates are ready-made app structures that help users get started quickly without having to build from scratch. These templates are especially useful for common business needs, such as customer support dashboards or employee onboarding apps. By using them, developers and business users can save time and reduce development effort, allowing faster rollout of business solutions.

## Work with variables in UI builder

To use the different variables that we have discussed above, refer to the **Variables Guide**. This guide is a template that allows users to experiment with and configure variables in the UI builder. Any of the variables can be added or removed depending on the app’s needs. We can also connect variables to our own data and create custom queries to run in our app. For example, we can use a variable to display a customer’s order history from a database or highlight data from a survey response. 

To get started, click on **Create New App** and then navigate to the Browse Templates section to locate the **Variables Guide**. Click on **Open** within the Variables Guide as shown below.

![Variables Guide](../../static/img/Navigating/varGuideCreation.png)

After naming our drag & drop app, click **Create**. We will then see an example app with different types of variables already in place. 

![Variables Example](../../static/img/Navigating/vartwo.png)

The Variables Guide includes multiple examples under each of the following variable types:
- **Engine Variables**: Unique system-generated values used to help the app function in the background.
- **Data Structure Variables**: These show common data formats like numbers, text, true/false values, labeled objects, and lists that can be reused across the App.
- **Block Variables**: These control what appears inside blocks, such as a product name or company title.
- **Notebook Variables**: Used when connecting the app to Notebooks. These power more advanced tasks like running calculations or displaying results from a data query.

Each example can provide clarity on how data flows through the app, and can be customized for different content, audience, or task.

Now, if we wish to remove some variables from the app, simply select the container it’s in and click the trashcan icon on the right-hand side as seen below.

![Delete block](../../static/img/Navigating/varDelete.png)

// File: Building Apps\Add Custom Reactors to Apps\Using Custom Reactors

# Using Custom Reactors

A key feature of SEMOSS is the ability to extend the platform's functionality with the use of custom reactors.  Not only do custom reactors allow you to define specific business logic, they also  amplify the power of SEMOSS by allowing you to leverage a vast array of Java libraries to fulfill your use case.

### How a Custom Reactor works

In SEMOSS, Projects are saved in Insights, The Insight object allows you to do everything for an app. Like running the pixel calls and for every project there exists asset files they would be available throught using an Insight as well. 

![InsightObject](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/InsightObject.png)

For testing a Custom Reactor which does not have a UI, use the terminal to load the Java files and test the functionality of the reactor.
This is available by going to apps then system apps in that click on Terminal app. 

BrowseAssetReactor is a Java object which loads the Assets in the UI. 

![BrowseAssetPixel](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/NetworkPixel.png)

![TerminalPixelCommands](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/TerminalCommands.png)

As shown here, BrowseAsset Reactor takes two parameters **filePath** which is relative filePath location and **space** which is nothing but the project Id.

For any reactor we can go to terminal and use **--help** to get the information about what inputs are required by the reactor. 
This is True for the custom Reactors also, as long as we write the description while creating the Custom Reactor. 

The next pages of this documentation shows a Basic Java Reactor Example and how a Custom Reactor helps in CRUD Operations in detail.

---

// File: Building Apps\Add Custom Reactors to Apps\Basic Java Example

## To-Do List App with SEMOSS Reactor Example
Let's start with a basic "To-Do List" drag-and-drop app. 

Here are the resources to follow along with this demo. Upload the app zip and database zip files to SEMOSS.
* [DB Zip](../../../static/assets/CustomReactorAppZips/CustomReactor_TodoList_DB.zip)
* [App Zip](../../../static/assets/CustomReactorAppZips/CustomReactor_TodoList_App.zip)

Once you open the app, you will see a form which allows users to input a task name, ID, and status, and displays the information in a database table:
![App Landing](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/AppLanding.jpg)

When a user fills out the form and hits the submit button, their task information is mapped to variables which are input into a pixel statement that inserts a new row into a DB table named `MY_TODO`:
![Submit new task](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/SubmitNewTask.jpg)
![Pixel call](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/AppVariables.jpg)

Executed Pixel: 
```
Database ( database = [ "<YOUR DB ID>" ] ) | Insert ( into = [ MY_TODO__TASK , MY_TODO__TASK_ID , MY_TODO__STATUS ] , values = [ ( "My new task" ) , ( "3" ) , ( "In-Progress" ) ] ) ;
```
Notice that the pixel call responsible for inserting the new row utilizes the `InsertReactor`, a standard reactor bundled with SEMOSS.

The new row then appears in the table:
![Table update](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/NewTaskTable.jpg)

Hence, using standard SEMOSS reactors such as the `InsertReactor` is sufficient for basic operations like above.

---

// File: Building Apps\Add Custom Reactors to Apps\CRUD Operations

## Using a Custom Reactor with To-Do List App
However, there are many cases where we may want to add an additional layer of functionality to the submission process. For example, some business logic use cases may include:
* sanitizing inputs/input validation,
* checking for duplicates or merging duplicate rows,
* triggering additional actions such as sending emails,
* executing custom Python scripts or shell code, etc.

To leverage the power of a custom reactor, let's create a new reactor for our app called `MyTodoReactor`. Similar to the `InsertReactor`, it will use same 3 inputs from the form (Task, Task ID, and Status) to insert new tasks into the `MY_TODO` table. 

In addition to inserting rows, we also want `MyTodoReactor` to:
* update existing task rows based on the Task ID, and
* delete a task from the table when the status is changed to "Complete"

This will elevate our basic app from only being able to create new tasks into a more functional **Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD)** app.

The Java source file for `MyTodoReactor` can be found [here](../../../static/assets/CustomReactorAppZips/MyTodoReactor.java).

To add the `MyTodoReactor` to the app context:
1. Navigate to the Files tab. If it does not exist yet, create a `java` folder inside of the `version/assets` folder. Within the `java` folder, create the subfolders for your reactor based on its package, then upload the reactor file: ![Folder tree](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/FolderTree.jpg)
Note that in this case,  the `MyTodoReactor` declares that it has a package of `mytodo.reactor` on its first line, which corresponds to the subfolders inside the `java` folder. 

2. Save the app, then return to the SEMOSS homepage. Find your app ID by clicking on the three dots icon on the lower right hand corner of the app, then click "Copy App ID" and save the copied ID to a safe place. ![App ID](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/AppID.jpg)

3. Open up the app again, then navigate to the Settings page, then go to the "Data Apps" tab and click "Compile Changes on this Instance". 
![App ID](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/AppSettings.jpg)
Note that you will need to perform this step to **re-compile changes** each time you alter the source code of the custom reactor in order for the changes to take effect.

Now, we can try using `MyTodoReactor`. We can replace the `InsertReactor` call that gets triggered upon form submission with the following pixel call syntax, making sure to replace your app and database IDs where needed:
```
SetContext("YOUR APP ID");

MyTodo ( database = [ "YOUR DB ID" ], values = [ ( "{{task-name}}" ) , ( "{{task-id}}" ) , ( "{{task-status}}" ) ]);
```
![Notebook](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/MyTodoNotebook.jpg)

Notice that:
1. We call the `SetContext` reactor before `MyTodo` so that the app recognizes where to load the custom `MyTodoReactor` class files from.
2. The syntax for calling `MyTodoReactor` is similar to the parameters for the `InsertReactor`.

Finally, let's test the `MyTodoReactor` functionality by submitting a few cases:
1. Submit a form where the task ID = 1 and the status is "Completed" to test that the reactor correctly deletes the row from the table:
![Task 1](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/Task1.jpg)
Output: ![Task 2 Output](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/Task1Output.jpg)

2. Submit a form where the task ID = 3 and the task name is changed to "Say goodbye":
![Task 3](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/Task3.jpg)
Output: ![Task 3 Output](../../../static/img/CustomReactor/Task3Output.jpg)

## Conclusion and Additional Links
Custom reactors are powerful because they allow you to integrate a wide array of Java libraries into the app and extend the functionality of your app beyond the native SEMOSS reactors. 

For more details on how to code custom reactors, please read through the [Custom Reactor Guide](../../Understanding%20Development/Java%20Development/Custom%20Reactors.md).

### Pixel Deep Dive
To better understand how Text2SQL is leveraged, let's delve into the 2 main Pixel reactors powering it.

1. **PredictDataTypes**

    To best model the data, the dataset must first be preprocessed to identify the headers and data types of each column. The PredictDataTypes reactor is responsible for performing this. It parses the dataset to identify if each column falls into one of the following Semoss data type categories:
    - BOOLEAN
	- INT
	- DOUBLE
	- STRING
	- DATE
	- TIMESTAMP

2. **NLPQuery2**

    The key to Text2SQL's functionality lies in the NLPQuery2 reactor, which is responsible for funneling the inputs (your dataset and the predicted data types from the previous step) into your selected LLM model. Based on the LLM's response, it parses the SQL query output and runs it against the uploaded dataset to generate the final output.

---

// File: Building Apps\App Templates\Ask LLM

import ReactPlayer from "react-player";

// File: Getting Started\How to Access SEMOSS

# How to Access SEMOSS
The primary way that most business users should access SEMOSS is through the **[live web server](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/)**.

The **[live web server](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/)** is a simple and low-overhead method to access SEMOSS. 

### Ready to Start?
Access the [live web server](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/) here and follow along with the **[Connecting to SEMOSS](../How%20To/Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md)** guide for detailed instructions on setting up your account and connections.


## Alternate Ways to Access SEMOSS (For Advanced Users)
For advanced users and developers, the live web server may not be sufficient for their business needs. Therefore, SEMOSS also supports two ways of installing the platform locally to give users full control over their local instance of SEMOSS: 

1. [Docker container](../Advanced%20Installation/Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md) (intermediate)
2. [Local/Source code installation](#semoss-local-installation) (advanced, suitable for developers)

## Local vs. Dockerized: Which one should I choose?
**Run a full local installation if you:**
* Want the ability to directly modify the core backend source code and configuration
* Want to contribute to the SEMOSS project
* Want to bring your own dependency versions
  
**Run a Docker container if you:**
* Want a prepackaged solution without having to manage and install packages/dependencies locally
* Do not need visibility into core backend logic
* Only plan to create custom backend reactors for your apps

**For most users, it is sufficient to run SEMOSS in a Docker container.** You can still create custom app logic when running SEMOSS in a Docker container. For instructions on how to run SEMOSS with Docker, click [here](../Advanced%20Installation/Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md). 

## SEMOSS Local Installation
SEMOSS, like most web apps, has a backend and a frontend. The **backend** is responsible for managing the data, models, and running the logic that underpins SEMOSS.
Meanwhile, the **frontend** provides a user interface that allows you to view and interact with SEMOSS in a browser.

You must install both the backend and the frontend in order to run SEMOSS locally.

## Installation Instructions
The installation steps differ slightly depending on whether your operating system is **Windows** or **OSX (Mac)**.
### Windows Installation Guide

Please click on the link below to find the Windows Installation Guide

*    [SEMOSS Installation for Windows](/windows-developer-install)



### OSX (Mac) Installation Guide

Please click on the below link to find Mac Installation Guide 

*    [SEMOSS Installation for Mac Silicon](../Advanced%20Installation/Mac%20Developer%20Install.md)

### Frontend install
To access the frontend local installation instructions, click [here](../Advanced%20Installation/Frontend%20Installation.md).

# App Library

App Library is a section in SEMOSS which consists of list of Gen AI applications present on the platform that are created by users. Once you click on a particular app in the App Library, it will open the App which is ready to use.

## Creating a new App

To create a new App, click on the top right corner of the homepage on **Create New App**.

![New App Button](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Create%20New%20App.png)

You can choose among the 4 different options of creating a new app. These are,

1. Code - You can build an app by coding using a framework or even from strach

    How to build a Code App has been covered in detail [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/React%20App%20In-Depth%20Guide.md).

2. Drag and Drop - This is no-code option of creating a new app

    How to build a Drag and Drop App has been covered in detail [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/By%20Drag%20&%20Drop.mdx).

3.  Agent Builder - This is also a no-code solution

    How to build an Agent Builder App has been covered in detail [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/By%20Agent%20Builder.md).

4. Template App

    If you don't want to build your app from scratch, you can choose utilize a template from the list of templates.

![Create New App Options](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Start%20build%20with%20a%20template.png)


After clicking the Create button in any of our tools, users are prompted to enter key app details like:
- name: The name of the app
- description: Description of the app
- app image: You can add a custom image for your app
- tags: When developing a new application, incorporating tags can significantly enhance both organization and navigation. Tags can be associated with various aspects of the app, such as its functionality or design. For example, if your app helps users plan trip itineraries, you might use tags like "travel planner" or "itinerary creator." These tags enable you to efficiently filter and locate the desired app within your entire library.


![New App Popup](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/New%20App%20Popup.png)

### Preview App

The Preview App button allows you to view and interact with your app as users would see it before it is published. This feature helps you test the user experience and overall layout without saving any changes made during the preview. If you notice anything that needs improvement, you can easily return to editing to make adjustments. Using the preview ensures your app meets your expectations before going live.

![Preview App](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Preview%20App.png)


### Share App

The Share App button allows you to easily distribute your app to others.

![Share App](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Share%20App.png)

We can share an App in two ways: 
#### URL

The is the most direct and quickest way of sharing an app with someone is using the URL option, one can copy the URL by clicking on the copy options right beside the URL, and share that link with others that you wanted to share. 

![Sharing via Url](../../../static/img/AppSharing/UrlSharing.png)


#### iFrame
Another way you can share the app is by sharing them the IFrame link of the app, to share an app using IFrame click on the IFrame tab  beside URL and you can copy the IFrame link and share it with others.

![Sharing via Iframe](../../../static/img/AppSharing/IframeSharing.png)
              
Using this way you can embed the app as an iframe. In the **HTML** code the website where you want to embed this app inside the body tag of that website paste this iframe tag contents that you copied by clicking the button in sharing menu. 

```html
<iframe frameborder="0"
            width="1000"
            height="600"
            style="border: 1px solid #ccc;" 
            src="https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-dev/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/#/s/d56c69e5-6ca0-47f9-ba41-e00eef987b45">
</iframe>
```

The attributes in the iframe tag can be changed accordingly to our use the default values such as frameborder, width, height, style etc. are defined such that the most suitable/optimised values, but feel free to change them to the required use.



### Save App

The Save App button ensures that all your changes and progress are securely stored as you work on your app. By clicking this button regularly, you can prevent accidental data loss and easily restore previous versions if needed. Some platforms may also offer an auto-save feature, so it’s a good idea to check your settings for additional protection. Consistently saving your work helps maintain the integrity of your app development process.

![Save App](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Save%20App.png)

### Show App

The Show App button lets you preview your app exactly as end users will see it. This feature is useful for verifying that everything appears and functions correctly after publishing, and for spotting any issues or missing content. The view is read-only, so if you need to make changes, simply return to the editing mode. Using Show App helps ensure your app is ready for your audience.

// File: Getting Started\Platform Navigation\Model Catalog

import ReactPlayer from "react-player"
import ModelsDemo from "../../../static/Demos/ModelsDemo.mp4";

# Model Catalog

Models are Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm that leverages deep learning techniques and vast datasets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. Gen AI Apps created on SEMOSS are built upon these advanced models.

<ReactPlayer controls url={ModelsDemo} />

To connect to existing model or add new models, click on the **model** icon on the left side of SEMOSS portal to access the Model catalog.

![Model Library](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/Model%20Catalog/Model.png)

The Model catalog displays a list of LLMs that are already accessible to you. If you do not have any existing LLMs in your current model catalog, you can go to **Discoverable models** to browse through the available models and request access:

## Adding a Model
Click on **Add Model**, choose your preferred model from the list and fill in the required details to connect to the model.

![Add Model](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/Connect_To_Model.PNG)

> _Various Model Options_

{/* <ReactPlayer controls url={ModelCatalog} /> */}

There are three primary types of models, each with distinct characteristics:

**Commercially-hosted Models -** Managed by an external vendor, these models come with a subscription or licensing fee. The vendor handles hosting and maintenance, offering highly scalable and customizable solutions.

**Locally-hosted Models -** Installed and managed on the organization's own servers, these models also come with a subscription or licensing fee. This setup gives the organization full control over the model, allowing for extensive customization to meet specific requirements.  

**Embedded Models -** Integrated with other software or platforms, these models focus on specific functions and can be seamlessly blended into existing systems.

## Usage
The usage tab for a model tells you how to use the model in JavaScript, Python and Java.

import VectorCatalogDemoNew from "../../../static/Demos/VectorCatalogDemoNew.mp4";

# Vector Catalog

A vector database is a specialized solution designed for the storage, indexing, and retrieval of massive datasets containing unstructured data. These databases leverage machine learning models and their embeddings to facilitate searching across various forms of unstructured data, including images, video, text, audio, and more. This is done with the help of pixel calls, a domain specific language (DSL) specific to SEMOSS that is used as the payload for all the operations that can be performed on an insight.

<ReactPlayer controls url={VectorCatalogDemoNew} /><br />

### Adding a Vector Database

To connect to a vector database, go to **App Library > Vector Catalog**

Click on **Add Vector** on the top-right section and it will take to different type of connections for Vector.

Choose an appropriate **Connection** based on your requirements.
![ConnectYourVector](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/Vector%20Catalog/Vector.png)

In this example, we will create a FAISS vector

Fill in the required FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) details. Click on **Add Vector**.
![AddDetails](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/Add%20Vector%20Details.PNG)

Your vector database is now ready to use.

## Embed Documents

To embed documents in your vector database, open your vector in the vector catalog.

Go to **Files**.

Click on **+ Embed New Document** to upload your data file. It only accepts files with .txt, .csv, ,pdf, .doc, .ppt extensions.
![Embed Data](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew5.png)

Click on **upload files** to select and upload your data and click on **Embed**. You can also drag and drop your file to the same window.
![Upload Files](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew6.png)

You should now be able to see your file inside the vector database.
![Data Files](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew7.png)

If you have questions regarding the policies or your datasets, go to **Q&A** tab and type in your query in the space provided.
![Q&A Tab](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew9.png)

Once the file is uploaded, run the following command.

`CreateEmbeddingsFromDocuments ( engine = "80a482d5-06b7-4ff6-bedc-0d0570b7bfeb" , filePaths = [ "TestFile.csv" ] , paramValues = [ { "columnsToIndex" : [ "content" ] } ] ) ;`

![EmbedDB](../../../static/img/VectorDatabase/EmbedDB.png)

> Execute this command to embed your vector database with the .csv file

- This will take a while to run. Once completed, your vector database is ready to use.

> **Note**
> The engine ID above needs to match the engine ID of the vector database you just created.

- To do so, go back to App Library > Vector Catalog by clicking the vector icon on the left-side.

> To be Added 

> Look for the database you just created.

### Custom Chunking

Custom chunking refers to the process of breaking down large pieces of data, such as documents, audio, or images, into smaller, manageable chunks before loading them into a vector database. This process optimizes the storage, retrieval, and processing of data within the database.


#### Upload a .csv file 
To achieve this we will upload a .csv file to the vector database with the following columns:

- **Source**: Name of the source doucment
- **Modality**: The method by which this chunk was produced (e.g., text, audio, image, etc.)
- **Divider**: The page from which this content was extracted (this is a string and can be values like 1, 2, etc., for content parsed across multiple pages)
- **Part**: integer for the part in the page it is grabbed from. If a page has dense text relative to the max tokens this will increase from 0 to n for that page
- **Tokens**: Integer for the number of tokens for the content
- **Content**: The actual string of the content grabbed

**Example**
```csv
Source,Modality,Divider,Part,Tokens,Content
Executive,text,1,2,475,"your content"
Executive,text,2,3,511,"your content"
Executive,text,3,4,498,"your content"
Executive,text,3,4,500,"your content"
```

// File: Getting Started\Platform Navigation\Settings\Setting Pages Overview

import ReactPlayer from "react-player";
import RemovingApp from "../../../../static/Demos/RemovingApp.mp4"

# Settings
You can find the Settings icon at the bottom left corner of the platform.

![Settings](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings1.png)

In the Settings section, you have give or revoke access of any App, Model, Function, Database, Vector, or Storage of which you are an author. You can even edit the type of access given to other practisioners, like changing the access from author to an editor or just a viewer. Below mentioned is the difference between the 3 types of permission.

## App Settings

When you click on the App Settings tab, you will see all the apps that are housed under the 'My Apps' section in your platform.

![AppSettings](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings2.png)

To change the access settings of any App, click on it. You will have to be an author of the app to edit the access settigs. If you are an author, you can either add members, revoke access from any existing members, or edit the access type.

![Member](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings3.png)

### Pending Request

You can also see if there are any Pending requests from any practisioners. If there are any requests, you can either approve or reject them. You can even control the type of access given (author, editor, or viewer).

![Pendingrequest](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings4.png)

### Data Apps

This is the section where you can deploy or publish your app. Click on **Data Apps** and you will find a UI similar to below,

![Data Apps](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings5.png)

To deploy or publish your app is to generate it's shareable link. To do this, make sure your toggle for 'Enable Publishing' is on and then hit on 'Publish'.

The generate link will contain your created app/ project and you can share this with anyone.

If you scroll below, you will find the 'Update Project' section.

![Update Project](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings6.png)

Here you can directly add files to you app/ project and then hit on 'Update'. Post this, when you click on 'Publish', the generated link will have the updated app/ project.


## Removing an App from SEMOSS

If you ever want to remove an App from your SEMOSS server, the first thing that you should do is navigate to your settings sections (the gear).

![Settings Tool](../../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/Settings%20Tool%20icon.PNG)

> _The settings tool_

Inside Settings, you should see a screen that has a settings sections for each of the resources you have in SEMOSS. Click on App Settings.

![App Settings](../../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/CfGAI%20Settings_2.PNG)

> _This will house all the Gen AI apps that you have in your App Catalog_

Here you will see each of your apps listed individually. Click on the app that you would like to delete.


> ![App 1](../../../../static/img/Navigating/settingspage.png)

> _All of your Apps displayed_

Once inside an app, you can easily delete it by clicking the delete button.

![Delete Button](../../../../static/img/Navigating/Navigating4.png)

> _Delete Button_

> **Warning**:
> This will **delete** the App for all users!

This process can be replicated for all other resource types (databases, models, storage catalogs, etc) in SEMOSS!

<ReactPlayer controls url={RemovingApp} />

## Model, Function, Database, Vector, Storage Setting

Settings for all the resources works in the same way as it is for App Settings. The only difference is that in these 5 resource settings you will not find the 'Data Apps' tab. Apart from this, all features and functuality remains the same.

// File: Getting Started\Platform Navigation\Settings\My Profile

My Profile page allows you to see information about the user logged in



![Access token](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings13.png)

## Access Tokens

Access tokens are useful for connecting to SEMOSS for development purposes. It generates an **Access Key** and a **Secret Key**, which can be used as environment variables to access SEMOSS.

To create a new Access Token, click on + New Key, highlighted in the image below.

![Access token](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings14.png)

Give a name to your request and add a description (optional) and hit generate.

![Access token](../../../../static/img/Settings/generatekey.png)

Once you hit generate, you will be able to see your 'Access Key' and 'Secret Key'. Please note that this is the only time your Secret Key is available to view.

After clicking 'Close', you will be redirected to the 'My Profile' page. Here, you will see your Access Tokens, including your Access Key (note that your Secret Key will not be visible).

Now to connect to SEMOSS using your keys, paste your key values into `.env.local`, `.env`, or Python module 
```
# .env
ENDPOINT="https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo"
MODULE="/cfg-ai-demo/Monolith"

#.env.local
ACCESS_KEY="<your access key>"
SECRET_KEY="<your secret key>"
```
```

# import the ai platform package
import ai_server

# pass in your access and secret keys to authenticate
server_connection=ai_server.RESTServer(
    access_key="<your access key>",            
    secret_key="<your secret key>",            
    base="https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/cfg-ai-demo/Monolith/api"
)
```

// File: Getting Started\Platform Navigation\Settings\Jobs

The Jobs section allows you to automate tasks that need to be executed at periodic intervals. To access this section, click on the Jobs button located on the Settings Home page.

![Jobs Home Page](../../../../static/img/Settings/Settings11.png)

In this section, you can view all the currently active jobs. Let's explore the functionalities of this section using these jobs as examples.

### Creating and Managing Jobs

1. **Name**: Give a unique name to the job.
2. **Frequency**: Set the frequency at which the job will be executed. For example, if the frequency is set to "Daily at 12 pm," the job will run every day at 12 noon.
3. **Timezone**: Specify the time zone for the scheduled frequency.
4. **Last Run**: Indicates the last time the job was executed.
5. **Status**: Shows whether the job is currently active.
6. **Modified By**: Displays the ID of the account that last edited the job.
7. **Actions**: This section includes three icons:
   - **Run Now (Arrow Icon)**: Manually execute the job immediately.
   - **Edit (Pencil Icon)**: Modify the job details.
   - **Delete (Wastebin Icon)**: Removes the job.

How to add a new job?

Click on Add button, you will see the below UI.

To add a new job, click on the Add button. You will see the following user interface:

// File: Getting Started\Platform Navigation\Settings\Permissions

There are 3 distinct permission levels that a user can choose from. For most resources, the majority of users with access should be Editors or Read-Only.

{/* > **Note**:
> Turnaround time for access is **variable**. Currently all access has to be approved by a user with **Author** privileges. */}

**Author**  
An author user has the ability to edit an App or the resource and to also grant users access to the app/resource. On a given team, only one or two people should have Author level privileges. This is to limit the amount of people that are able to change the resource.

**Editor**  
An Editor has access to the app/resource and can freely make pixel calls to query the resource. This should be the base level that is given to most users, especially to developers who want to create Gen AI apps that utilize the SEMOSS server.

**Read-Only**  
This level of access should only be given to users who are meant to demo already created applications. They will be unable to generate new data but can see any generated data.

// File: How To\App Creation Guides\By Agent Builder

import ReactPlayer from "react-player"
import AgentBuilderDemo from "../../../static/Demos/AgentBuilderDemo.mp4";

# Using Agent Builder to Create a New App

Agent Builder is a Drag and Drop feature in SEMOSS designed for developing applications where users can input data and receive corresponding outputs. Agent Builder simplifies UI creation by requiring only a prompt to define the input types the user will provide and expected outputs of the app.

<ReactPlayer controls url={AgentBuilderDemo} />

Initially, we will create a prompt that specifies the types of inputs users will provide and the expected outputs. Once this initial UI is generated, the Agent Builder app functions just like any other Drag and Drop app in SEMOSS. Let's understand the process to develop an app via Agent Builder.

To use Agent Builder, first click on **Create New App** button on the top right corner of your SEMOSS home page and then click on **Get Started** on the Agent Builder tab.


![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB13.png)

## Create a Prompt

### Prompt Details

In this section, we give a name to our prompt. Also, we will select a model (LLM) through which the prompt will run to provide the output based on user input.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB9.png)

### Define the Prompt

In the "Prompt Context" section, we will write the actual prompt that defines the input options for the user and outlines the app's UI. To write a prompt, imagine you are talking to the app as if it were a living being and explain its role. For instance, if you are creating an itinerary planner app, you might say, "Suppose you are a travel agent." This sets the context for the app's role.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB3.png)

### Including User Inputs and Expected Output

We will also include the inputs the user will provide and the expected output the app should present. For example, a sample prompt for a travel guide app could be:

*“Suppose you are a travel agent. The user will provide the destination, number of days of travel, and their travel pace preference (slow or fast). Prepare an itinerary for them.”*
In this example, we have:
    1. Told the app about its role.
    2.	Mentioned the inputs the user will provide.
    3.	Specified the expected output.


### Defining Input Parameters
The inputs that the user decides are called input parameters. We need to inform the app about these input parameters, which the user will provide data for. To do this, include the input parameters inside double curly brackets \{\{ \}\}. This way, the app knows that these are the input parameters provided by the user. Our sample prompt will be updated to: 

*“Suppose you are a travel agent. The user will provide the \{\{destination\}\}, \{\{number of days\}\} of travel, and their \{\{travel pace\}\} preference (slow or fast). Prepare an itinerary for them.”*

You can also set input parameters under the ‘Set Inputs' section after creating the prompt. Click on the word you want to create as an input parameter.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB4.png)


### Test Prompt

After you define your input and select your model (LLM), you can test your prompt against the LLM and decide if the model fits your app’s needs.

### Define Input Types

In this section, you can define the type of the input parameter you have selected. You can choose between any of the options in the dropdown that best suits the input needed.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB5.png)

### Set Constraints

In this last section before previewing your prompt, you can set constraints for the output. Examples include limiting responses to a certain number of words, specifying whether the output should be in bullet points or not, etc..

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB6.png)

### Preview Prompt

Click on the "Preview" button to save your settings. You will be directed to the preview of the prompt.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB10.png)

Click on Create App to complete creating the app. You will be directed to the UI page where you will be able to see the input parameters that you created. Once you enter inputs for these prompts, the App will run through the model and provide an output.

## Post Initial App Development

### Editing the prompt

It is possible to edit the original prompt you have created. To do this, go to your app in the App Library and click on **Edit** in the top right corner.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB11.png)

Now go to the Data tab and click on Notebooks tab and then on **Prompt Query**. Here, inside the query,  encapsultaed by the double quotes, we can edit the original prompt. Save the changes so it reflects in the UI.

![AB](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AB12.png)

### Editing the UI tab or Data tab

Using Agent Builder, by providing a prompt, we can develop the entire app. This automatically sets up the UI and creates the required queries (notebooks) and variables in the Data tab. However, you can still edit the UI by adding or removing blocks, or by adding more queries (notebooks) and creating variables. This process mimics the Drag and Drop app.

If we want to edit the **UI tab**, by adding different blocks like HTML, Iframe, or an Image, you can follow the steps mentioned in the documentation of the Drag and Drop app. Please click on the link below for detailed instructions:.

*    [Edit the UI tab](./No%20Code%20App%20Creation%20by%20Drag%20and%20Drop.mdx#Design)

If we want to edit the **Data tab** by adding more queries or variables, it is recommended to delete this app and use the Drag and Drop feature to create a new app. Please refer to the documentation in the link below for guidance:

*    [Edit the Data tab](./No%20Code%20App%20Creation%20by%20Drag%20and%20Drop.mdx#using-the-notebook-tab)

# React App Quickstart Guide


## Overview 

The intent of this guide is to get a user up and running with a sample React app, allowing them to start developing a Gen AI app quickly and efficiently. 

This guide is perfect if you have an idea for a prompt and want access to your hosted data in SEMOSS. 

## Prerequisites

We will have the same basic prerequisities as the [Frontend Installation Guide](../../Advanced%20Installation/Frontend%20Installation.md)

Once you have VSCode and Node installed, come back to this page to continue the guide. 

For this guide, the frontend package manager that we will be using is pnpm, which you can install using the following command:

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

## Sample Project Code 

![Pic 1](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy1pic.PNG)
> _Policy App_

For this project we will be using our Policy App. To access this app, please navigate to:

[SEMOSS Apps GitHub](https://github.com/Deloitte-Default/cfgai-apps)
> **Note**
> This is a protected GitHub, make sure you have access and are signed in, you'll otherwise get a 404 Error.

If you do not have access to this GitHub, that's ok! Please contact a SEMOSS member and they will give you read/write privileges as soon as they can. 

As you can see there are a fair amount of apps to choose from here. 

![Pic 2](../../../static/img/policyapp/Policy2pic.PNG)
> _Apps List_

To access the policy app, we are going to quickly clone it into our local environment. 

### Step 1: Creating Local File

The first part of cloning the repository is to create a place to store the folders. Personally, I created a Gitlab folder where all of my Git related projects reside. 

![Pic 3](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy3pic.png)
> _Local Folder for Git Projects_

After you create the folder, navigate to it in a local terminal. 

![Pic4](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy4pic.PNG)
> _Navigating Local Folder in command prompt_

Here we will start the cloning process. Looking at the GitHub repository, click into the Code Section and copy the specific git link as indicated in the picture below. 

![pic 5](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy5pic.png)
> _Code button in Github repository_

After this we can clone it to our local with a quick terminal command:

![pic6](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy6pic.PNG)
> _Cloning SEMOSS App locally_

As you can see in the picture above, the root folder is the new Gitlab folder that I created specifically to house my AI apps. 


### Step 2: Opening the Policy App 

Now that we have access to the Policy App locally, we can open it in VSCode and start our development journey. 

![pic7](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy7pic.PNG)
> _General VS code structure_

The general VS Code structure is shown above. To get to Policy App, open a new terminal in VSCode; inside of that terminal navigate to the client folder by typing in the following:

```
cd policy/client
```



![pic8](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy8pic.png)
> _Access to Policy App client folder in VS_


The client folder will be where all of our Frontend code resides. To read a more comprehensive guide on the structure of a SEMOSS app, you can look at this guide: [React App Technical Guide](React%20App%20In-Depth%20Guide.md). For now we will focus on the client folder. 

### Step 3: Installing Dependencies

Once we are in the client folder, we can install all of the project dependencies by running: 

```
pnpm install
```

If you do not have access to pnpm or node, there are instructions for downloading those in the [Frontend Installation Guide](../../Advanced%20Installation/Frontend%20Installation.md)

Now we are ready to connect the Policy App to SEMOSS! 

## Connecting to SEMOSS

Now that we have access to sample code and have taken care of all dependencies, we want to connect our app to SEMOSS and get started developing. 

### Step 1: Creating a .env.local file

In order to connect to SEMOSS we first need to amend our .env files to point to the correct access and secret keys. 

First navigate to your .env file. It should look like this:

![pic9](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy9pic.PNG)
> _.env file in VS_

If you do not have these credentials, they are shown below for easy copy/pasting

```
ENDPOINT="https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo"
MODULE='/Monolith'
```

We now want to add user specific information. In order to not expose this to the greater population, we will put these in a .env.local file. Create a file called `.env.local` and put the following into it:

```
ACCESS_KEY=
SECRET_KEY=
```

We will populate these fields in a second. But for now this is what your two files should look like:

![Pic10](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy10pic.png)
> _Click on highlighted to create new file_

### Step 2: Generating an ACCESS_KEY and a SECRET_KEY

The following link will show you how to [generate an Access Key and a Secret Key](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md).

Once you have those, populate your `.env.local` file with the proper codes. 

![Pic 11](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy11pic.PNG)
> _final .env & .env.local files on VS_

This is what your final `.env.local` and `.env` files should look like (though with your specific access and secret keys). 

Now we are ready to connect our App! 


### Step 3: Starting a Frontend Server

We are going to create a local frontend server that will connect to our SEMOSS server. 

Navigate back to your terminal. Make sure that you are still in `policy/client`. 

Once you are in the right directory run `pnpm run dev` in your terminal.

![Pic12](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy12pic.PNG)
>_Create local server by running above command in command prompt_

In most instances this will create a local server in port 3000. 

Once it fully loads, you should be connected to SEMOSS and your frontend should look like this:

![Pic13](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy13pic.PNG)
>_Policy App running on local server_

Congrats! You are now connected to SEMOSS. 

If this is your first time connecting to CFG, then you might need to populate your server with the resources you need to start analyzing data. Head over to [Navigating SEMOSS](../../Get%20Started/Navigation) to learn more. 

## Customizing the Policy Bot

Now that we have Policy Bot up and running, we are ready to start creating our own application on top of this skeleton. 

To do so, navigate to `PolicyPage.tsx`. It should be located in `policy/client/src/pages`

![Pic14](../../../static/img/policyapp/policy14pic.PNG)
> _Homepage of Policy App in VS_

This page is the main Homepage of the Policy Bot. You can start playing with pixel calls and templating here. 

For a more detailed guide on building your own Gen AI app, you can continue learning [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/React%20App%20In-Depth%20Guide.md). 

This is a more in-depth guide that goes into each portion of the development. 

## Adding Your App to the SEMOSS App Catalog

If you are happy with where your app is, and want to publish it to the SEMOSS App Catalog, the process is fairly simple. 

### Bundle Your App

In order to have your app reflect all of your recent changes, you need to make sure to bundle your app. To do this, ensure that you have the following script in your `client/package.json` file:
```
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "build": "webpack --mode=production --node-env=production",
    ...
  }
```

From the `client` directory, run the command `npm run build` in your terminal. Webpack will bundle your app and the bundled files will automatically be added to your `/portals` directory. If you don't see any files populate that folder, then you likely have an issue with your Webpack configuration.

## Adding Your App to the SEMOSS App Catalog

1. Compress all the directories in your project _except_ your `/client` folder. Ensure that you do this within the app directory. For example, if my app files are in a folder called `/MyApp`, I should not zip `/MyApp` itself. I should navigate into `/MyApp` and zip all the relevant directories inside of it. 

2. Navigate to [App Library](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/) and click "Create a New App" in the top right corner. This will bring you to the Create New App page.

![Create New App](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/app_building_options.png)

3. Click to "Get Started" under the Code option. Give your app a name and hit "Create." This will bring you to the Code Editor.

4. Click the Upload App Assets button at the top of the code file tree.

![Upload App Assets Button](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/code_editor_asset_upload.png)

5. Attach your zip file in the modal that appears and hit "Upload."

![Upload App Assets Modal](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/asset_upload_dialog.png)

6. Ta-da! You have successfully uploaded your code app to the SEMOSS Server!

## Updating your App In CFG

Once you have finished making any updates to your app, these are the steps that you should follow to update your app in CFG. 

1. Use the previous section to bundle your app correctly. 
2. Compress all the directories in your project _except_ your `/client` folder. Ensure that you do this within the app directory. For example, if my app files are in a folder called `/MyApp`, I should not zip `/MyApp` itself. I should navigate into `/MyApp` and zip all the relevant directories inside of it. 
3. Navigate to your App in the App Library. Click the Edit App Icon in the top right. 
![Edit App](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/demoAPP_edit.PNG)
4. Once in the Edit App tab, navigate to the Settings Tab. 
![Settings Tab](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_settings.PNG)
5. Once in the settings section, you want to go to the Data Apps Section. 
![Data Apps](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_data.PNG)
6. Once you are in Data Apps, you want to take the zip that you created in Step Two and upload it in the dropdown and press update! Once this is done your app will be fully updated. 
![Update App](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_update.PNG)
   

> **Hints or Additional Info:**
> Sometimes when you upload you will immediately get a 404 error, this is a known bug that is being worked on. If you refresh your page, everything will resume working normally.

# Creating a GenAI app using Streamlit

## Overview

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create custom web apps for machine learning and data science. Its a very useful tool for Data Scientists and Analysts to create analytical models and to query large databases. 

Streamlit has its own documentation that goes through its functionality and implementation. Its useful to go through and look through that here:

[Streamlit Documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io/)

Futhermore, Streamlit has a great gallery of apps that users have created. Its a useful repository of ideas and concepts that many find helpful:

[Apps Gallery](https://streamlit.io/gallery)

Please note that as of now there is no native integration of Streamlit as a hosted SEMOSS app. However, Streamlit is very useful for quick presentations and Proof-of-Concept creations. Converting them into a SEMOSS app would require using either the [VanillaJS Use Case](VanillaJS%20App%20Quickstart%20Guide.md) or the [React Use Case](React%20App%20Quickstart%20Guide.md). In the future there will be a Streamlit conversion guide that will be a more comprehensive guide for converting a streamlit app into a hosted SEMOSS app.  

You are, however, able to connect a Streamlit app to use the Models, Databases, and Storage Catalogs that are present in your SEMOSS server. This guide will go through and show how to run a local Streamlit app using your SEMOSS data.

It is important to keep in mind that Streamlit also requires a running backend server.

# Installation Guide 

## Generate Access Key from your AI server 

The first step to gaining access to the data stored in your SEMOSS server is to generate an access key and a secret key. To do this, click on the link below. After you have generated your keys, navigate back to this guide to complete your Streamlit integration. 

[Generate Access Key](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md)

## Install the Streamlit and AI Server Packages
Open up a command prompt or terminal. 
Then, run the following commands to install Streamlit and AI Server:
```
pip install streamlit
pip install ai-server-sdk
```
> **Note**
> This guide assumes that you already have Python (3.9+) and pip installed. If you do not, please follow the [Back End Setup](../../Advanced%20Installation/Local%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md) section first.

## Integrate with Streamlit 

In this example we will take an existing streamlit app and modify it to be compatible with the SEMOSS server instead of Open AI.

### Step 1: **Clone the Chatbot.py code**

We are going to create a simple app that has a conversation with a given LLM or Model Engine. We cloned the code from [Chatbot.py](https://github.com/streamlit/llm-examples/blob/main/Chatbot.py).

The starting code is as follows:

```python
import openai
import streamlit as st

with st.sidebar:
    openai_api_key = st.text_input("OpenAI API Key", key="chatbot_api_key", type="password")
    "[Get an OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)"
    "[View the source code](https://github.com/streamlit/llm-examples/blob/main/Chatbot.py)"
    "[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/streamlit/llm-examples?quickstart=1)"

st.title("💬 Chatbot")
st.caption("🚀 A streamlit chatbot powered by OpenAI LLM")
if "messages" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state["messages"] = [{"role": "assistant", "content": "How can I help you?"}]

for msg in st.session_state.messages:
    st.chat_message(msg["role"]).write(msg["content"])

if prompt := st.chat_input():
    if not openai_api_key:
        st.info("Please add your OpenAI API key to continue.")
        st.stop()

    openai.api_key = openai_api_key
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    st.chat_message("user").write(prompt)
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(model="gpt-3.5-turbo", messages=st.session_state.messages)
    msg = response.choices[0].message
    st.session_state.messages.append(msg)
    st.chat_message("assistant").write(msg.content)
```

The original Streamlit App looked like this 

![Streamlit](../../../static/img/StreamlitImages/ai-server-chatbot-app.png)


We are going to make it use the AI Server's Model Engine Catalog by implementing the changes mentioned below -

![Streamlit](../../../static/img/StreamlitImages/update-steps.png)

### Step 2: **Removing the openai import and replacing it with ai_server** 
```python
## Change 1 ##
# Replace openai package with ai_server
import ai_server
import streamlit as st
```

The ai_server function 

### Step 3: **Create a login function**

Every api call that is made usually requires some level of authentication. In order to avoid this, we are can create a caching function that stores our access and secret keys and stops streamlit from re-executing the login call. 

```python
## Change 2 ##
# Create a function to login into the server using your access keys
@st.cache_resource # Use st.cache to cache the server authentication logic
def login(secret_key, access_key, ai_server_url):
    try:
        # Attempt to create the server connection. If there is an error when connecting then an error will be raised
        conn = ai_server.RESTServer(
            access_key=access_key,
            secret_key=secret_key,
            base=ai_server_url
        )
        return conn
    except:
        # If login fails, display an error message
        st.error("Login failed")
``` 

### Step 4: **Updating the side bar**

Instead of providing a secret key for Open AI we will change the inputs to match the AI Server login requirements and indicate which model engine you would like to inference with. *Some of these fields can be hard coded depending on the use case*.

```python
## Change 3 ##
st.title("💬 Chatbot")
# Change the display reference from OpenAI LLM to SEMOSS Server
st.caption("🚀 A streamlit chatbot powered by SEMOSS Server")

# Remove OpenAI secret and add additional inputs in the side bar menu
with st.sidebar:
    ai_server_url = st.text_input("AI Server URL")                          # Your backend endpoint
    secret_key = st.text_input("Secret Key", type="password")               # Your AI Server Secret Key
    access_key = st.text_input("Access Key", type="password")               # Your AI Server Access Key
    engine_id = st.text_input("Model Engine ID", key="model_engine_id")     # The model engine ID
    server_connection = login(secret_key, access_key, ai_server_url)        # make the loging call
```
Currently Streamlit apps can only interact with SEMOSS when you are running an instance of SEMOSS locally. As such, you need point your server to your backend. In most instances this will be the Monolith server that you setup and run. 

If you were actively developing then you might want to consider hard coding your access credentials so that you don't have to enter them every time. That change would look as follow:

```python
# Harcoded Example of the above
# Remove OpenAI secret and add additional inputs in the side bar menu
with st.sidebar:
    ai_server_url = "<your monolith endpoint>"                              # Your Monolith endpoint
    secret_key = "<your secret key>"                                        # Your AI Server Secret Key
    access_key = "<your access key>"                                        # Your AI Server Access Key
    engine_id = st.text_input("Model Engine ID", key="model_engine_id")     # The model engine ID
    server_connection = login(secret_key, access_key, ai_server_url)        # make the loging call
```

### Step 5: **Redefine safety checks before inference calls**

Instead of requiring an OpenAI secret key, we will ensure that the user was able to connect to the server and provided a model engine ID.

```python
## Change 4 ##
# When the prompt is provided, make the connection was established and an engine ID was provided
if prompt := st.chat_input():
    if not server_connection:
        st.warning("Please login before trying to make an inference call.")
        st.stop()

    if not engine_id:
        st.info("Please add Model Engine ID.")
        st.stop()
```

### Step 6: **Update the payload logic**

Finally we just need to change the way we are accessing and recording the response from the model engine.
```python
    ## Change 5 ##
    ## Create a reference to the model engine ##
    model = ai_server.ModelEngine(engine_id = engine_id, insight_id = server_connection.cur_insight)

    # No changes here
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "user", "content": prompt})
    st.chat_message("user").write(prompt)

    # update the inference call to use ModelEngine
    response = model.ask(question = prompt)
    # Get the output string from the response
    msg = response[0]['response']
    # match the dictionary responses for OpenAI
    st.session_state.messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": msg})
    st.chat_message("assistant").write(msg)
```

The final result is as follows:

# Drag and Drop Blocks to Build UI for your new App

To build UI for a new app, we can Drag and Drop UI components to customize the app's design as per our requirement. We have different building blocks to design the app and add data to it.

Before starting let us first have a top level understanding of the app creation process. The overall process can be divided in 3 tabs- **UI**, **Notebook**, and **Variables**.
**UI tab**- Here, we drag and drop the UI elements to build our app design. This section defines how our app will look and what features and elements will it have for the user.
**Notebook tab**- Here we create requests to be made from the multiple app resources we have at our peril
**Variables tab**- Here connect the **UI tab** with the **Notebook tab**. Variables tab empowers us to enter an input (and hit a command) and the App will run through a relevant data repository and provide an output.

**Notebook** and **Variables** tabs combine to form the **Data tab**.

To use this feature, click on **Create New App** and then click on **Get Started** in Drag and Drop as shown below.

![Drag and Drop UI](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/Drag%20and%20Drop.png)

Enter name of the new app. It will then go to the page where we can start building UI for our app. In the leftmost column we can see **UI**, **Data**, **Dev**, and **Settings** tabs. Click on **UI** and then on **Block tab** on the left side of the page as highlighted below.

![Input](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND2.png)

You will be able to see the various blocks that can be used to build the UI. The different blocks and information about their usage are listed below.

## Design

### Element

Here we can add basic elements in the app like HTML, IFrame or an image block. **HTML** block is added to the App for inclusion of a web page. We can either generate HTML page using AI or can write a customized HTML code. **IFrame** block can be used when we want to add a web page into the App interface.

We can add images using the **Image block**. After adding an Image block (by drag and drop), we can click on **Block Settings tab** (on the left side of the page) and put url of the image we want to insert along with also mentioning its position in the block and setting the dimension details.

![Input](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND3.png)

### Input

This category will enable to add Input placeholder to the page using Audio Player, Button, Checkbox, Select, Input, Toggle Button, or Upload. **Button** is added to the page so that we can click on it to execute an action or get the output of App. **Checkbox** is added to the page to check & un-check any condition in the App.

**Select** is added to the page to provide us with drop-down options as input which we can select to get our output. After adding a Select block (by drag and drop), we can click on **Block Settings tab** (on the left side of the page) and customize the input values and even add a query to it if required. **Input** is similar to **Select** but here input can be entered from the user instead of choosing from drop down. **Toggle Button** gives the option to switch on/off any feature or condition in the App. **Upload** is added to the page to provide an option to the user to upload any file which can be used in the App.

![Input](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND4.png)

### Layout and Progress

This category will enable to build UI layout using Containers and Query. **Container Block** is a block in which we can enter other blocks like Element, Input or Text. Using the Block Settings tab, we can customize the specifications of the container from Layout to Border. **Progress** block is added to display progress of any feature/element in the App.

![Layout](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND5.png)

### Text

This category will enable to add Text to the page using Link, Logs, Markdown or Text blocks. **Link** is added to the page to provide a link within App to another page or a file (details of the link can added by clicking on Block setting and selecting the **link block**). **Logs** are embedded in the App to track App performance and user activities. **Markdown** is a block in which we can put text formatted as headers, lists, bold, italics, etc. for web pages (Block Settings tab can be used to customize the specifications). **Text** is a block in which we can put plain text as required by the App on its UI (to format it, we can click on Block Settings, select the Text block and use the customization section).

![Text](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND6.png)

**Layers tab** on the left as shown below will list all the blocks that are layered in a App.

![Text](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND7.png)

## Data

**Data tab** in the leftmost cloumn enables users to connect the CFG platform resources like Model, Database, Storage, etc. with the App.

In the **Notebook tab**, we can add a query and enter an ID to it and it will take us to a cell where we can enter our code in Pixel, Python or R.

![Scripting Language](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND8.png)

Here it is important to understand difference between query and query cell. Query or Notebook consists of query cells. A query can have multiple cells. We can also create multiple queries (or notebooks) in the **Notebook tab**. A query is generally a complete set of action contributing to the operation of the App. For example consider payment feature in an app, so the entering payment details, hitting enter, talking to the bank server, everything can together form a Payment queries. And these entering payment details, hitting enter, etc. will the different cells within the query.

Sometimes these cells functions maybe required in some other queries as well. For example, talking to a bank server may even be required when authenticating the user. So some other query (like User autentication in our example) may also use 'talking to the bank server' query cell which is defined in the 'payment query'. Thus we see that we can even connect cells which are part of different queries or notebooks.

Under cells, we can choose either of **Code** cell (represented by **\<\> cell**) or **Query Import** cell and then write a code or query to access CFG resources as per app requirement.

![Multiple cells](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND9.png)

In case we choose **Code** cell, we can go to the CFG resource (Model, Database, Storage, Vector Database, etc.) which we want to connect with the app and click on the usage tab within the resource. We can copy the code based on scripting language we have chosen for the cell and paste it in the Notebook query cell. We can also modify this code or write a customized code altogether.

![Usage tab in CFG resource](../../../static/img/Navigating/Resource%20Usage%20Tab.PNG)

In **Query Import** cell, we can write a database query and select Database from the list of Databases we have access to.

![Database drop-down list](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND10.png)

Query import cell differs from Code cell in how it represents data. Using query import cell we can get data in tabular form (or Data Frame). As shown below, we have queried data from **diabetes** Database and got the data in a tabular form as a response below the cell.

![Data Frame](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND11.png)

We can also transform data presented in the colums of the table using **Transformation** option. Some of the transformations possible include converting smallcase to capitals, etc. To transform any column's data, click on **Transformation** and choose type of transformation mnentioned among the list.

![Transformation](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND12.png)

After that a new cell for selected transformation will appear below and in that choose the Frame in which we want to transform data. Then select required details as per the transformation type chosen and run the query. We can then see modified/updated data in the Frame compared to previously shown data as displayed in below screenshot.

![Transformation Uppercase](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND13.png)

### Creating and using variables

Now finally we will connect the UI with our created queries. For this, we click on the **Variables tab**, then on **add(+)** on the left side of the panel and define the variable by adding details as shown below. In the UI tab, we have add different types of blocks (like image, text, button, etc.), thus we can define our variable as the type of the block we want to connect it with.

![Create variables](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND14.png)

After defining variables, write the code and replace constants in it with variables that we have just created as highlighted in the screenshot below.

![Input variables](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/Variableinquery.png)

Now our code is ready to use and we can click on **Run all** to check that it is running correctly or not. If there is some error, please make sure code language chosen is correct and variables are defined accurately.

Below mentioned are elements different blocks have to connect itself with data,

![Connect Query ID with UI Block](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/Connect%20Query.png)

To link query in Notebook with Button block we can click on **"New Action"** on the right hand side under **ONCLICK** and enter query type and query ID as shown below.

![Link Query with Action Block](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/Query%20linked%20to%20action.png)

To connect a query that automatically runs when an App page is opened, select **page** block that embeds all other blocks and click on **New Action** on the right hand side under **ON PAGE LOAD** and enter query type and query ID as shown in below screenshot.We can add multiple queries to the Page and they will automatically run whenever someone opens the App Page.

![Page Query](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/Pagequery.png)

Click on **Settings** to set accessibility of App and Delete the App as shown below.

![Settings Icon](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/DND15.png)

After making all the changes, we can Preview the App before saving and can Save it thereafter. We can also share the link of the App with other members or users as required.

Now we can go into App Library and click on the App we have created. We can see the UI of the App we have created as seen below.

![UI Built Application](../../../static/img/Navigating/UI%20Built%20Application.PNG)

<ReactPlayer controls url={DragandDrop} />

# Use pre-built templates

Developers and business users can use these pre-built templates to create and customize apps. This makes the devopment process quicker and accelerates time to delivery.

## Work with blocks in UI builder

To use different blocks that we have discussed above, there is a **Block Guide**. It is a template that allow users to experiment with each of the blocks in the UI builder. We can leverage all blocks in the template or remove some blocks as required in the app. We can also connect our own data to this app and customize queries that will run the app.

To create new app using **Block Guide**, click on **Create New App** and then click on **open** in Block Guide within browse template section as shown below.

![Browse Template Block Guide](../../../static/img/Navigating/BrowseTemplateBlockGuide.PNG)

Enter the name we want to give to the App and then click on **Create**. After entering the template, we can browse from top to bottom to see through all the blocks present in the App.

![Block Guide App](../../../static/img/Navigating/BlockGuideApp.PNG)

Each block consist of a description which will provide information to user related to the function of that block.

Now if we wish to remove some blocks from the App, select those blocks and **Delete** to remove them from the App as seen below.

![Delete block](../../../static/img/Navigating/Delete%20Block.PNG)

We can modify configuration of blocks as required by the App by changing details on the right side of a block.

![Modifying block](../../../static/img/Navigating/Modifying%20Block.PNG)

To create and modify queries for connecting data to blocks in **Design** tab, go to **Data** tab and work around queries/code as per App requirement as we have discussed in the Data(Notebook) section above. Data tab of block guide is shown below.

![Data tab with queries](../../../static/img/Navigating/Datatabwithqueries.PNG)

Once we connect queries in data tab to blocks and update configurations of these blocks, we can save the App and now its ready to use.

![Created App](../../../static/img/Navigating/NewAppThroughBlockGuide.PNG)

<ReactPlayer controls url={BlockGuideDemo} />

## Landing Page Guide

Use this template to create a landing page for your app. You can customize it as per your needs using the design and data tab.

Go to App Library Home Page and click on **Create New App**.

![CreateApp](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/LandingPage1.png)

You will have your answer in the response box once the query runs successfully.

![Response Generated](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AskLLM5.png)

You might get an error in case you do not have access to the model that this app is using. Request access to that LLM or swap it with any other model in your model catalog that you already have access to.

![Ask LLM Error](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AskLLMError.png)

Save your app when you finalize the changes and share with other users.

<ReactPlayer controls url={AskLLMTemplateDemo} />

## Ask CSV Guide

Use this template to create a basic app that lets you generate an SQL query to read data from an SQL file. You can upload a csv file and type in the question for the data you need. The app will return a CSV query in response.

Go to App Library Home Page and click on **Create New App**.

![CreateApp](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/LandingPage1.png)

Scroll down to **Browse Templates** and go to **Ask CSV** and click Open.

Once it runs successfully, it will return the SQL query you need to retrieve the data for the question you asked earlier.

![Query Results](../../../static/img/Navigating/Create%20New%20App/AskCSV6.png)

Save your app when you finalize the changes and share with other users.

<ReactPlayer controls url={AskCSVTemplateDemo} />

# Commonly Asked Questions

## Using Upload Block

When using **Upload Block** in the App and using **Python** as scripting language in code/query, we should use **"ROOT + "file"** in code as shown below, for calling the **file** instead of just using **"file"** as in case of **Pixel.**

![Python Prefix for Upload Block](../../../static/img/Navigating/Pythonprefixforuploadblock.png)

After making this tweak in the query code, we can run the App seemlessly. As shown below, after uploading a csv file, we can run the App without any hiccups.

// File: How To\App Creation Guides\VanillaJS App Quickstart Guide

# Creating a GenAI app using VanillaJS


## Overview

Vanilla JavaScript, often referred to as 'VanillaJS,' is the core and foundational form of the JavaScript programming language. It serves as the fundamental building block of web development, enabling you to incorporate dynamic and interactive features into your web applications. 

Demo App to be created
![Demo App](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/Demo_App.png)


## Connecting to SEMOSS

- [Generating Access and Secret Keys](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md)

## Setup

For this guide we are going to be using a pre-existing 'demo' app, which has a good base of html in it already.  Navigate to the template below and download the demo app code into your local storage to get started. 

- [Template file for demo app](https://github.com/Deloitte-Default/cfgai-apps/blob/main/demo/portals/index.html)
> **Note**
> This is a protected GitHub, if you do not have access to it, or are not currently signed in to your GitHub account you will get a 404 Error. Ask an admin for access.

## Importing Insight and Env

Once you have access to the demo app's code you may notice that there is a portion near line 39 where we import Insight and Env into the application. We then use this code to create a new Insight. 

![Importing Insight](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/ImportingInsight.PNG)

This is an integral portion to being able to access the models, storage catalogues, databases, etc that is stored in your SEMOSS instance. If you'd like to know more about what an Insight is, and why it is useful, you can read more about it here:

[What is an Insight](../../Get%20Started/Key%20Concepts.md#what-is-an-insight)

There is also some documentation on what actions having access to Insight allows you to do here:

[Usefulness of an Insight](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Using%20the%20SDK.md#using-insights)

For now, however, we just want to make note that we are importing an Insight, and later on creating an insight, allowing us the ability to access the information stored in our SEMOSS app, whether that be where our app is hosted or if we were to run the app locally. 

## Calling an LLM 

Now that we have imported an Insight into our app, we have access to the LLMs stored in the model catalogue of our SEMOSS instance. 

![Model Catalog](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/ModelCatalog.png)

If you do not have any existing LLMs in your current model catalog, you can go to discoverable models, browse through our available models and when you find one, request access:

![Requesting Access](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/RequestingAccess.PNG)

In order to use any LLM, you need to find its model ID. This is essential in order to call the LLM. In order to find what the model id is for any given LLM, you should navigate to the specific model in the model catalog. Go into the Usage tab, and the model id will be there:

![Model Id](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/ModelID.PNG)

Once you have access to a model, you can add its model ID into the portion of the VanillaJS Demo code. That can be found here: 

![Engine ID](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/Engine_ID.PNG)

Once we have access to a model id, we then can make a call to the LLM model using the askModel insight action. 

```
if (insight.isReady) {
          const { output } = await insight.actions.askModel(ENGINE, command);
```

In the demo app, the command that we pass in is the simple prompt that the user puts into the command box. You can see that we grab that right above where we invoke the command:

```
        // set the variables
        const command = data.get("command");
```
This is the prompt that we are sending to the LLM. In the demo case, we are simply sending the text that the user inputs. However, in some more advanced cases we could change the user string, and add additional inputs to the prompt. We would mutate the string here, and then feed that into the LLM using the askModel command showcased above. 


## Adding Your App to App Catalog


**Creating Portals Folder**

Create the 'portals' folder inside your sample app folder (in this case 'demo'). Add the index.html file to the folder. Our sample app's portals folder looks like the following:

![Portals](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/Portals_folder.png)

Next we need to compress the files so that the .zip file opens up to the directory containing our Portals folder which should look like this:

![Zip Files](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/Zip_file.png)

You are now ready to upload your app.

**Once you have added all your files into the structure:**

1. Navigate to https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/#/

2. Click "Add App"
![Add App](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/Add_App.png)

3. Fill in the required fields 
![Requirements](../../../static/img/VanillaJS/Adding_Demo_App.PNG)

4. Upload your zip file 

5. Click "Upload" (Note: this may take a few minutes to spin up). 

6. Ta-da! You have successfully created an app in the SEMOSS Server! (Note:If you get an error, click to go back on your browser and you should be able to see you app in the catalogue)

# Creating a SEMOSS GenAI App Using React

## Overview
This documentation focuses on the front end aspects of building a GenAI app. React is a Javascript-based User Interface (UI) framework. It improves reusability of UI elements to keep code readable and DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself"). You can leverage React to develop a hosted front end with the potential to have some custom backend functionality that is deployed on the SEMOSS Server.

The languages used in this app will be Typescript/Javascript, and HTML in building your app. Typescript is an extension of Javascript that improves code quality and allows for a better developer experience.

## Prerequisites
### Node.js
You can install Node on your machine by downloading the appropriate installer for your device directly from the Node.js website. Version [v18.16.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.16.0/) is suggested for our projects (for most Windows machines, you should download `node-v18.16.0-x64.msi`). 

### Code Editor
You'll need to have your code editor of choice downloaded on your machine. We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
<!--Should we mention something about installing VSCode extensions for typescript/javascript?-->

## Examples
You can see app examples in the [SEMOSS Apps](https://github.com/Deloitte-Default/cfgai-apps) repo. Feel free to download an existing app and use it as scaffold for building your own! Existing work can be used to experiment and learn.
> **Note**
> This is a protected GitHub, if you do not have access to it, or are not currently signed in to your GitHub account you will get a 404 Error. Ask an admin for access.
<!--Should we link to the public CFG demo here so that first time users can click around and explore the apps in the live site? For a user encountering this guide for the first time, they probably won't know how to interact with the apps in the CFGai-apps repo. It might be useful to copy the "Adding your app to the SEMOSS catalog" section of this guide over to the CFGai-apps repo's README.md so that users can be guided on what to do after they've pulled the repo (ex. zipping the files and adding the app within CFG)-->
<!--Since this is a React app use case, do all the examples in the CFGai-apps repo also use React? I'm not sure how important this is but it might be helpful for users following this guide to base their app off of another React app in the CFGai-apps repo-->

## App Structure
Below is the typical structure of a React app to be uploaded onto the SEMOSS platform. The `/java` and `/py` directories hold back-end work. This document will focus on the `client` and `portals` folders.
<pre>
  <code>
    ├── <a href="#client">client</a>
    │   ├── <a href="#clientsrc">src</a>
    │   │   ├── <a href="#clientsrcassets">assets</a>

  </code>
</pre>

### `/client`

#### `/client/.env` / `/client/.env.local`
See the Environment Variables section of [Connecting to the CFG App](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md)

#### `/client/package.json`
NPM/PNPM stands for Node Package Manager and is included with Node. (PNPM is a newer, faster version of NPM but both can be used interchangably. If you find you don't have the `pnpm` command, you can install it with the following command: `npm install -g pnpm`.) 

NPM is how you can install [Node packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) that will help you on your app building journey. If you are using an existing project as a scaffold, you can run `pnpm install` **from the `client` directory** to download and install all the packages that are already in your package.json file. Otherwise, manually install required and suggested packages.

Below is a guide to required and suggested packages, but there are thousands out there that you can explore and use. Just make sure you choose ones that are reputable and actively managed!

##### Required Packages

| Package    | Installation Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)  | `pnpm i react` |
| [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) | `pnpm i react-dom` |
| [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)    | `pnpm i webpack` |
| [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli) | `pnpm i webpack` |
| [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) | `pnpm i html-webpack-plugin` |
| [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) | `pnpm i webpack-dev-server` |
| [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) | `pnpm i --save-dev dotenv` |
| [SEMOSS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semoss/sdk-react) | `pnpm install @semoss/sdk-react/npm install @semoss/sdk` |

##### Helpful Packages

| Package    | Installation Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)  | `pnpm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` |
| [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) | `pnpm i react-router-dom` |

#### `/client/tsconfig.json`
This is a configuration file that indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. It specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. Read more on it [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

#### `/client/webpack.config.js`
This is a configuration file that tells Webpack how to bundle your Javascript files so they can be displayed in a browser. Read more on it [here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/).

#### `/client/src`
The `src` directory holds all the source files that make up the front end of your app.

##### `/client/src/assets`
This directory stores all your web assets, like logos, photos, and graphics.

##### `/client/src/components`
React is a component-driven framework. You can read more about component-driven UI development [here](https://www.componentdriven.org/#why). You can think of components like elements of a larger picture or pieces of a puzzle. This directory will contain all the components you develop to be used in your app pages, and you can organize them into sub-directories as you see fit.

Note that in order to use the hooks provided by the SEMOSS SDK, the component must be a functional component. Here's a helpful [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-functional-components-and-class-components/) on the difference between functional and class components in React.

##### `/client/src/pages`
This directory contains full app pages, which likely leverage the custom components that you've created.

##### `/client/src/utilities`
This directory contains any non-component shared code you might need for your app. For example, you might have a `HelpText.tsx` file to keep all the help text for your app in one place. You might have a `NumberUtilties.tsx` file that has functions to standardize number formatting across your app.

##### `/client/src/App.tsx`
This files serves as the main component that will hold all your app contents/pages. For SEMOSS apps, the component returned in this file will need to wrap its content with `<UseInsights></UseInsights>` in order to utilize the SEMOSS SDK. Read more about it on [Front End Installation](../../Advanced%20Installation/Frontend%20Installation.md).
<!--As a front end newbie, I think it would be helpful to have a diagram that illustrates the relationship between the Semoss SDK, the App.tsx component, the pages that are in App.tsx, and the (smaller) components that are used on the pages-->

##### `/client/src/global.d.ts`
This file allows you declare global modules for import. For example, you might want to set up a module to import all .png files from your `/client/src/assets` folder so you can use the image somewhere in your app. (See an example of that [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51100401/typescript-image-import))

##### `/client/src/main.tsx`
This file connects your App to the HTML template by looking for the root element in your template. This file is typically structured like so:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { App } from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

##### `/client/src/template.html`
This file serves as the entrypoint for HtmlWebpackPlugin to build the HTML files for your project. `template` is the standard name, but you can customize it and specify it in your plugin configuration in `webpack.config.js`. See the Html WebpackPlugin Usage [documentation](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#usage) for details.

The `template.html` will contain an HTML element with an id of `root` that `main.tsx` will hook onto, for example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title><%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %></title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

### portals
This is the destination folder that should be configured as the [output](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/) in `webpack.config.js`. For example:
```
const config = {
    ...,
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../portals'),
        filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
        clean: true,
    },
    ...
```
All you have to do is have the folder. Running Webpack will do the rest! (More on that in the [Bundling Your App](#bundling-your-app) section.)

## Connecting to a SEMOSS Instance

See [Connecting to CFG](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md) for documentation on how to set up your app with API keys to be added as environment variables.

## Using the SEMOSS SDK

Learn more about how to use the SEMOSS SDK in the [Using the SDK](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Using%20the%20SDK.md) guide.

## Local Development with Webpack

Ensure that you have the following script in your `client/package.json` file:
```
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "dev": "webpack serve",
    ...
  }
```

From the `client` directory, run the command `npm run dev` in your terminal. This will start the Webpack server for your local project. Here's an example of what it looks like when the script is executed:
```
PS C:\Development\cfgai-apps\llm-tuner\client> npm run dev

> dev
> webpack serve

<i> [webpack-dev-server] [HPM] Proxy created: /Monolith  -> https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:3000/, http://127.0.0.1:3000/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from 'C:\Development\cfgai-apps\llm-tuner\client\public' directory
<i> [webpack-dev-server] 404s will fallback to '/index.html'
asset main.5c6e6707538d8566f277.js 3.43 MiB [emitted] [immutable] [big] (name: main)        
asset logo.svg 1.27 KiB [emitted]
asset index.html 371 bytes [emitted]
orphan modules 1.82 MiB [orphan] 961 modules
runtime modules 30.4 KiB 15 modules
cacheable modules 2.5 MiB 423 modules
webpack 5.88.2 compiled successfully in 14852 ms
```

In this output, you can confirm that the proxy created matches the module and endpoint set up in your .env.local. If you navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser, you'll be able to see your app. So long as this task is running in your terminal, Webpack will watch for changes so they will appear in the browser when the changed file is saved (occasionally, this make take a while or you'll have to refresh the browser page). 

## Bundling Your App

Ensure that you have the following script in your `client/package.json` file:
```
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "build": "webpack --mode=production --node-env=production",
    ...
  }
```

From the `client` directory, run the command `npm run build` in your terminal. Webpack will bundle your app and the bundled files will automatically be added to your `/portals` directory. If you don't see any files populate that folder, then you likely have an issue with your Webpack configuration.

## Adding Your App to the SEMOSS App Catalog

1. Compress all the directories in your project _except_ your `/client` folder. Ensure that you do this within the app directory. For example, if my app files are in a folder called `/MyApp`, I should not zip `/MyApp` itself. I should navigate into `/MyApp` and zip all the relevant directories inside of it. 
2. Navigate to [App Library](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/) and click "Create a New App" in the top right corner. This will bring you to the Create New App page.
![Create New App](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/app_building_options.png)
3. Click to "Get Started" under the Code option. Give your app a name and hit "Create." This will bring you to the Code Editor.
4. Click the Upload App Assets button at the top of the code file tree.
![Upload App Assets Button](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/code_editor_asset_upload.png)
5. Attach your zip file in the modal that appears and hit "Upload."
![Upload App Assets Modal](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/asset_upload_dialog.png)
6. Ta-da! You have successfully uploaded your code app to the SEMOSS Server!

## Updating your App In CFG

Once you have finished making any updates to your app, these are the steps that you should follow to update your app in CFG. 

1. Use the previous section to bundle your app correctly. 
2. Compress all the directories in your project _except_ your `/client` folder. Ensure that you do this within the app directory. For example, if my app files are in a folder called `/MyApp`, I should not zip `/MyApp` itself. I should navigate into `/MyApp` and zip all the relevant directories inside of it. 
3. Navigate to your App in the App Library. Click the Edit App Icon in the top right. 
![Edit App](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/demoAPP_edit.PNG)
4. Once in the Edit App tab, navigate to the Settings Tab. 
![Settings Tab](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_settings.PNG)
5. Once in the settings section, you want to go to the Data Apps Section. 
![Data Apps](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_data.PNG)
6. Once you are in Data Apps, you want to take the zip that you created in Step Two and upload it in the dropdown and press update! Once this is done your app will be fully updated.

// File: How To\App Creation Guides\Frames

<!-- TODO need a blurb about what a frame is-->

<!-- TODO need steps on how to create a frame in a notebook-->

### Creating Frames in the UI
You can load data from various sources into frames

1. Go to Semoss UI
2. Click the Create New Insight (+) button
3. Upload a new File
4. Click the gear icon located at the bottom left of the panel.
5. Choose the IDataFrame type you want to use
Always choose the appropriate frameType:
    1. GRID for tabular data
    2. PY for Python
    3. R for R scripts
    4. GRAPH for visualizations
6. Import data!

### Changing Frame Types
You can update your dashboards, notebooks and change the frame type via pixel

Depending on the context of your frame, you would need to change the Pixel step that determines the frame type

In this example following the steps from the UI above
1. Open the terminal
2. Copy the all the pixels commands and change the frame type:
```
FileRead ( filePath = [ "/your_file_name.xlsx" ] , dataTypeMap = [ { "INT" , "Authorized_Supplier" : "STRING" , "Authorized_Supplier_Product_Number" : "INT" , "UOP" : "STRING" , "Qty_Ordered" : "INT" , "Quantity_UoP_Back_Order" : "INT" , "Backorder_Date" : "DATE" , "Expected_BO_Release_Date" : "DATE" , "FY_YTD_Qty_Ordered" : "INT" , "Prior_FY_Qty_Ordered" : "INT" , "FY_Backorder_Qty" : "INT" , "Customers_on_Backorder" : "INT" , "Item_on_Allocation" : "STRING" , "Problem_Cause" : "STRING" , "Comments" : "STRING" } ] , delimiter = [ "," ] , newHeaders = [ { } ] , sheetName = [ "Backorder Report" ] , sheetRange = [ "A1:Y2" ] , fileName = [ "backorder_test_upload.xlsx" ] , additionalDataTypes = [ ...] ) | Import ( frame = [ CreateFrame ( frameType = [ GRID ] , override = [ true ] ) .as ( [ "your_file_name_xlsx_FRAME845276" ] ) ] ) ;

output: {"name": "your_file_name_xlsx_FRAME845276", "type": "GRID"}
```


4. Paste and execute all the pixels to have the data reload in the new frame!

### Frame Pixels
Here are some helpful pixels for frames

#### Creating a new Frame
The pixel to create a new frame
```
CreateFrame ( frameType = [ GRID ] , override = [ true ] ) .as ( [ "frameName" ] ) ;
```
#### View Exisiting columns in a Frame
```
frameName | FrameHeaders();
```

#### Frame Type
To check the type of frame you are using
```
frameName | FrameType();
```

# Regression Testing Using ToPDF

## Overview

You can use the **ToPdf** reactor to snapshot visualizations and dashboards for visual regression testing in SEMOSS. This is useful when you want to ensure that your dashboards look the same after upgrading SEMOSS to a new version.

The workflow is:
- Take screenshots of your dashboards using ToPdf on your current SEMOSS version.
- After updating SEMOSS, rerun ToPdf to generate new PDFs.
- Compare the new PDFs to the old ones to check for visual differences.

If the PDFs do not match, you know something has changed between the two SEMOSS versions.


## How ToPdf Works

The ToPdf reactor takes an input with HTML content, searches for `<semoss>` tags, and uses Headless Chrome to take screenshots of the URLs specified in those tags. The screenshots are then formatted into a PDF according to the provided HTML and CSS.

### Example Input

```python
ToPdf(
  html=["<encode><html> <head> <title>Semoss Screenshot as PDF</title> <style> *{margin: 0; padding: 0;}.imgbox{display: grid; height: 100%;}.center-fit{max-width: 100%; max-height: 100vh; margin: auto;}</style></head> <body> <semoss class=\"center-fit\" url=\"http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/#!/insight?engine=8d356496-f940-42a0-82c4-159d86d78541&id=a3ca18c7-2d1b-4c9f-b395-a796b24f87a3\"/> <semoss class=\"center-fit\" url=\"http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/#!/insight?engine=8b6cdcc4-d4ba-43a1-98b6-9b30b7a07902&id=e1c1565c-a731-4570-840a-8f528630126f&sheet=0\"/> </body> </html></encode>"],
  url=["http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/"],
  filePath=["C:/workspace/example.pdf"]
)
```

- **html**: Contains the HTML structure, CSS, and `<semoss>` tags with URLs to snapshot.
- **url**: The base URL for your SEMOSS instance.
- **filePath**: The path where the PDF will be saved.


## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open SEMOSS in your browser

![SEMOSS Home](/img/UseCases/SemossUrlCheck.jpeg)

### 2. Get the Embed URL for your dashboard

Go to the dashboard or insight you want to test, click on **Share / Export**, and select **Embed**.

![Share Export Embed](/img/UseCases/UrlFinding.jpeg)

Copy the Embed URL for use in your `<semoss>` tag.

### 3. Example Output

After running ToPdf, you will get a PDF with screenshots of your dashboards, similar to the example below:

![Sample PDF Output](/img/UseCases/OutputDashboard.jpeg)


## Explanation

- The **html** parameter defines the layout and which dashboards to snapshot using `<semoss>` tags.
- Each `<semoss>` tag should have a `url` attribute pointing to the dashboard or insight you want to capture.
- You can find these URLs in SEMOSS by clicking “Share or Export” > “Embed” and copying the Embed URL.
- To capture specific sheets, append `&sheet=0`, `&sheet=1`, etc., to the URL.
- You can use as many `<semoss>` tags as needed and include any valid HTML or CSS for formatting.

### Notes

- Always wrap your HTML in `<encode>` tags for correct parsing.
- Screenshots may take time, as Chrome loads the dashboard and waits (typically 10 seconds) for rendering.
- If you omit the `filePath` parameter, the PDF will be saved to your Downloads folder.


## Parameter Breakdown

### html

Defines the HTML and which dashboards to snapshot.

```html
<encode>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Semoss Screenshot as PDF</title>
    <style>
      *{margin: 0; padding: 0;}
      .imgbox{display: grid; height: 100%;}
      .center-fit{max-width: 100%; max-height: 100vh; margin: auto;}
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <semoss class="center-fit" url="http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/#!/insight?engine=8d356496-f940-42a0-82c4-159d86d78541&id=a3ca18c7-2d1b-4c9f-b395-a796b24f87a3"/>
    <semoss class="center-fit" url="http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/#!/insight?engine=8b6cdcc4-d4ba-43a1-98b6-9b30b7a07902&id=e1c1565c-a731-4570-840a-8f528630126f&sheet=0"/>
  </body>
</html>
</encode>
```

### url

The base URL of your SEMOSS instance, e.g.:

```
url=["http://localhost:8080/SemossWeb/"]
```

### filePath

Where the PDF will be saved:

```
filePath=["C:/workspace/example.pdf"]
```


## Tips

- Use the **Embed** feature in SEMOSS to get the correct URLs for your dashboards.
- Use CSS classes like `center-fit` to control the layout in the PDF.
- Chain multiple `<semoss>` tags to capture multiple dashboards or sheets.


With this approach, you can automate visual regression testing for your SEMOSS dashboards using ToPdf!

// File: How To\System Components\Layers Panel

# Layers Panel
SEMOSS allows you to easily create an app using drag-and-drop features. 
When customizing an app's UI through the drag-and-drop editor, you can use the layers panel to visualize and adjust nested components.

#### Accessing the Layers Panel
To get started with the layers panel, navigate to the Apps page and select the "Create New App" button on the top right, then fill out the app name in the pop up screen.
![CatalogPage](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/CreateNewApp.jpg)

Choose the "Drag and Drop" editor option.
![EditorPage](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/DragAndDropLanding.jpg)

Once your app editor opens, select the "Layers" tab from the left hand menu.
![AppLanding](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/AppLanding.jpg)

This will expand the Layers panel.
![LayersMenu](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/LayersLanding.jpg)

Within the Layers panel, you will notice that the app automatically created a template consisting of one page that has a container and a text box with a welcome message inside.

#### Blocks and Layers
When creating an app's UI through the drag-and-drop editor, you can add a variety of visual components to your app by inserting "blocks" from the blocks menu, which can be accessed by clicking the "Blocks" tab on the left hand side.
![BlocksMenu](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/BlocksMenu.jpg)

The blocks menu displays many types of blocks that are available for use. The "Layout" category of blocks helps organize the structure of the page by allowing other blocks to be nested inside of it. For example, one type of layout block is a "container," which allows other blocks to be placed inside of it. This helps organize components that are logically or visually connected into one unit.

The layers panel allows you to re-order blocks and nest blocks inside of containers. For example, here is an example with a container block that has two nested text blocks inside of it:
![OneContainer](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/OneContainer.jpg)

To nest a text box inside of a container, you can drag the text box block on top of the parent container within the layers panel.
![NestBlock](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/NestBlock.jpg)

You can un-nest blocks in the same manner by dragging them out of the parent container in the layers panel:
![UnnestBlock](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/UnnestBlock.jpg)

You can also use the drag and drop method to change the order of the containers themselves on the page, or the order of nested blocks within a container. 
![ReorderBlock](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/ReorderBlock.jpg)

The layers panel displays blocks in order from top to bottom, left to right.
![ReorderBlock2](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/ReorderBlock2.jpg)

You can add multiple layout blocks and nest content inside of them, then adjust and view them from the layers panel as well.
![TwoContainers](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/TwoContainers.jpg)

#### Adding a Page
Not only does the layers panel support editing components on a single page,  it also allows you to add pages and navigate between them in the drag-and-drop editor. This is helpful if your app will have multiple pages.

To add a page, click on the + button in the top right of the layers menu:
![AddPage](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/NewPage.jpg)

This will open your new page as a tab to the right of any existing pages. You will also see the new page appear under the list of pages in the layers menu. 

To navigate to a different page, you can click on its name in the pages list in the layers panel. If the page is already open in your editor, you can also click on the page tab along the top bar to navigate to that page.
![SwitchPage](../../../static/img/DragAndDrop/SwitchPage.jpg)

// File: How To\System Components\Layout\Sidebar Block

# Sidebar Menu Block
The sidebar menu is a layout component which organizes contents into a menu. It lends itself to apps that require a collapsible menu bar for navigating between pages or listing links.

Just like other layout components, you can nest other content blocks inside the sidebar block.

### How to Add a Sidebar Menu
In the drag and drop editor, open the Blocks menu to access all of the available layout components:
![BlocksMenu](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/BlocksMenu.jpg)

Drag the "Sidebar" block into your page.
![SidebarLanding](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/SidebarLanding.jpg)

Now that you have added a sidebar block, you can nest content like links and text boxes inside it. To add a link, return to the blocks menu and drag a "Link" component into  the sidebar on your page.
![DragLink](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/DragLink.jpg)

After your links appear, you can view them in the layers panel nested under the Sidebar block.
![NestedLinks](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/NestedLinks.jpg)

To customize your sidebar, first select the sidebar component either by clicking on the sidebar directly, or by selecting it from the list in the layers panel. Next, click the "Block Settings" tab on the right hand side of the editor to expand the the Block Settings panel.
![BlockSettingsPanel](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/BlockSettingsPanel.jpg)

This will open a menu with customization options for the sidebar menu.
![SidebarSettings](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/SidebarSettings.jpg)

One key option is the "Open State" which determines whether the sidebar menu should be expanded (true) or collapsed (false) by default. You can manually set the open state value, or link it to a variable or code block output from your app notebooks.
![OpenState](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/OpenState.jpg)

In addition, you can also customize the sidebar's visual traits like the color, alignment, border, padding, etc. 
![VisualOptions](../../../../static/img/SidebarMenu/VisualOptions.jpg)

// File: How To\Vector Databases\Creating a Vector Database

# Creating a Vector Database

## Using the CreateVectorDatabaseEngine() Reactor
- **CreateVectorDatabaseEngine():** This allows you to setup and configure a new vector database engine into your backend. You can specify the type of storage and other details using 2 input parameters.
  - _Input 0:_ `database` - Fill in the name/ engine ID of the database you want to use within ("").
  - _Input 1:_ `conDetails` - Provide the map or collection of data that speciifes details to establish connection with the database within (""), each element separated by a coma(,).
  - _Input 2:_ `filePaths` - Any additional around file paths that may be required.

## JavaScript Example
```javascript
const createVectorDatabaseEngine = async (newVector, vectorOptions) => {
    let engine;

    const engineNames = vectorOptions.map(option => option.database_name);

    if (!engineNames.includes(newVector)) {
        try {
            const pixel = `CreateVectorDatabaseEngine(database = ["${newVector}"], conDetails = [{"VECTOR_TYPE": "FAISS", "NAME": "${newVector}", "EMBEDDER_ENGINE_ID": "${process.env.EMBEDDER}", "INDEX_CLASSES": "default", "CHUNKING_STRATEGY": "ALL", "CONTENT_LENGTH": 512, "CONTENT_OVERLAP": 20, "DISTANCE_METHOD": "Squared Euclidean (L2) distance", "RETAIN_EXTRACTED_TEXT": "false"}]);`;
            const response = await actions.run(pixel);
            const { output } = response.pixelReturn[0];
            engine = output;
            console.log('Vector Database Engine Created:', engine);
        } catch (e) {
            console.error('Error creating vector database engine:', e.message || e);
        }
    } else {
        engine = vectorOptions.find(option => option.database_name === newVector);
        console.log('Using existing Vector Database Engine:', engine);
    }

    return engine;
};
```
### Explanation

1. **Function Definition**: The `createVectorDatabaseEngine` function is defined as an asynchronous function that takes `newVector` and `vectorOptions` as parameters.
2. **Engine Names Extraction**: It extracts the names of existing vector databases from `vectorOptions`.
3. **Check for Existing Engine**: It checks if `newVector` already exists in the list of engine names.
4. **Create New Engine**: If `newVector` does not exist, it constructs the `pixel` string and calls `actions.run(pixel)` to create the new vector database engine.
5. **Handle Response**: It handles the response and logs the created engine or any errors that occur.
6. **Use Existing Engine**: If `newVector` already exists, it finds and logs the existing engine.
7. **Return Engine**: The function returns the created or found engine.


## Python Example

```python
import os

def create_vector_database_engine(new_vector, vector_options):
    engine = None

    engine_names = [option['database_name'] for option in vector_options]

    if new_vector not in engine_names:
        try:
            pixel = f'CreateVectorDatabaseEngine(database = ["{new_vector}"], conDetails = [{{"VECTOR_TYPE": "FAISS", "NAME": "{new_vector}", "EMBEDDER_ENGINE_ID": "{os.getenv("EMBEDDER")}", "INDEX_CLASSES": "default", "CHUNKING_STRATEGY": "ALL", "CONTENT_LENGTH": 512, "CONTENT_OVERLAP": 20, "DISTANCE_METHOD": "Squared Euclidean (L2) distance", "RETAIN_EXTRACTED_TEXT": "false"}}]);'
            response = actions.run(pixel)
            output = response['pixelReturn'][0]['output']
            engine = output
            print('Vector Database Engine Created:', engine)
        except Exception as e:
            print('Error creating vector database engine:', str(e))
    else:
        engine = next(option for option in vector_options if option['database_name'] == new_vector)
        print('Using existing Vector Database Engine:', engine)

    return engine

```

6. **Use Existing Engine**: If `new_vector` already exists, it finds and logs the existing engine.
7. **Return Engine**: The function returns the created or found engine.
8. **Example Usage**: An example usage of the function is provided, demonstrating how to call `create_vector_database_engine` with sample data.

## Java Example

```java
NounMetadata result = new CreateVectorDatabaseEngineReactor()
    .store.setNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.DATABASE.getKey(), createGenRowStruct("MyVectorDatabase"))
    .store.setNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.CONNECTION_DETAILS.getKey(), createGenRowStruct(Map.of(
        IVectorDatabaseEngine.VECTOR_TYPE, "FAISS",
        Constants.EMBEDDER_ENGINE_ID, "embedder-engine-id"
    )))
    .store.setNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.GLOBAL.getKey(), createGenRowStruct("true"))
    .execute();
```
### Explanation

1. **Instantiation**:
   - `CreateVectorDatabaseEngineReactor reactor = new CreateVectorDatabaseEngineReactor();`
     - This creates a new instance of the `CreateVectorDatabaseEngineReactor` class.

2. **Setting Up Context**:
   - `reactor.store.setNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.DATABASE.getKey(), createGenRowStruct("MyVectorDatabase"));`
     - Sets the database name to "MyVectorDatabase".
   - `reactor.store.setNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.CONNECTION_DETAILS.getKey(), createGenRowStruct(Map.of(
       IVectorDatabaseEngine.VECTOR_TYPE, "FAISS",
       Constants.EMBEDDER_ENGINE_ID, "embedder-engine-id"
     )));`
     - Sets the connection details, specifying the vector type as "FAISS" and providing an embedder engine ID.
   - `reactor.store.setNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.GLOBAL.getKey(), createGenRowStruct("true"));`
     - Sets the global flag to true.

3. **Method Call**:
   - `NounMetadata result = reactor.execute();`
     - Calls the `execute` method on the `CreateVectorDatabaseEngineReactor` instance and stores the result in the `result` variable.

# AI Server SDK for Python

Developers can use the AI Server SDK for Python to seamlessly integrate with the SEMOSS platform, enabling them to leverage powerful AI and machine learning capabilities directly within their Python applications. This SDK simplifies the process of connecting to a SEMOSS server, managing insights, and utilizing various engines such as ModelEngine, VectorEngine, DatabaseEngine, FunctionEngine, and StorageEngine. 

By using this SDK, developers can efficiently perform tasks such as creating and managing insights, querying databases, performing advanced inferencing, managing documents, and executing custom functions, all while maintaining a streamlined and scalable workflow. This integration empowers developers to build robust AI-driven solutions with ease, enhancing their applications with sophisticated data analysis, genAI, and machine learning functionalities.


## Install Dependencies

```Python
%pip install --upgrade ai-server-sdk
%pip install python-dotenv
```

## Server Connection & Insights

Here we connect to the demo instance of SEMOSS, but you would connect to your own instance. In SEMOSS, an **Insight** is best described as a temporary space that allows you to create what you want. Put simply, it is a hosted workspace where you are able to upload your app and access your hosted data. 


```python
import os
from ai_server import ServerClient
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv('../.env')
# Local creds
SECRET_KEY = '7d1238af-32ba-4cf4-802a-5afd5b07e618'
ACCESS_KEY = 'd0283ac7-fb36-4295-b4b8-b011420fd6df'
connection_url = 'http://localhost:9090/Monolith/api'

# This object creates a connection to the SEMOSS server
server_connection = ServerClient(base = connection_url, access_key = ACCESS_KEY, secret_key = SECRET_KEY)

# Check if you are connected to the server
is_connected = server_connection.connected
print(f"Am I connected to the server? {is_connected}")

# Initilizing the server creates a new insight which is accessible through .cur_insight
my_insight = server_connection.cur_insight
print(f"This is my current insight ID: {my_insight}")
```

#### Using Python to execute a pixel

This Python code utilizes the SEMOSS library to create an instance of `Insight` and executes a pixel operation.

```python
from semoss import Insight
insight = Insight(insight_id = '${i}')
insight.run_pixel("MyEngines()")
```

- **Insight Object Creation**: The line `insight = Insight(insight_id = '${i}')` creates an instance of the `Insight` class by passing an `insight_id`. This ID references a specific insight within the SEMOSS platform.

- **Executing Pixel**: The `insight.run_pixel("MyEngines()")` function call executes the pixel, `MyEngines()`, on the associated insight.

- **Please Visit**: [Frequently Used Pixel Calls](../Understanding%20Development/Java%20Development/Pixels.md#list-of-useful-pixel-calls) for more information about commonly used pixels


## Create New Insights

```Python
# You can create new insights by calling the .make_new_insight() method
new_insight = server_connection.make_new_insight() # This becomes your active insight

print(f"My current insight is now: {server_connection.cur_insight}")
```

## Listing Open Insights

```python
my_open_insights = server_connection.get_open_insights()

print(f"These are my open insights: {my_open_insights}")
```

## Dropping Insights

```python
# You can drop all of your insights with the .drop_insights() method and passing in the list of insights
# Here we drop all of our open insight ids 
server_connection.drop_insights(my_open_insights) # This will create a new insight id since there must be an active insight

print(f"Here are my insight IDs after dropping: {server_connection.get_open_insights()}")
```

## Check Attributes

```python
attributes = dir(server_connection)
# Find all of the attributes available to the server connection object
attributes = [attr for attr in attributes if not attr.startswith('__')]

print(f"Here are the attributes of the server connection object: {attributes}")
```

## Using LLMS

Here's how we can use the `ModelEngine` object to interact with a LLM

### Basic Inferencing

In this example, we create a `ModelEngine` object with specific IDs, ask it a question, and then print out the response along with some additional details about the interaction.

```python
from ai_server import ModelEngine

# An ID for the specific LLM you want to interact with
engine_id = '4801422a-5c62-421e-a00c-05c6a9e15de8'

# We need to pass the engine id and an insight id to the ModelEngine object
llama3_model = ModelEngine(engine_id=engine_id, insight_id = server_connection.cur_insight)

question = "How many ping pong balls can fit into an olympic swimming pool?"

# The ask method sends a question to the model and returns the response
try:
    answer = llama3_model.ask(question)
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occured: {e}")

print(answer['response'])

print("We also get acess to: ")
print(f"messageId: {answer['messageId']}")
print(f"roomId: {answer['roomId']}")
print(f"numberOfTokensInPrompt", answer['numberOfTokensInPrompt'])
print(f"numberOfTokensInResponse", answer['numberOfTokensInResponse'])
```

### Advanced Inferencing with Parameters

When working with advanced inferencing in language models, you can fine-tune the responses by adding various parameters. These parameters can control how the model generates its answers, making it more tailored to your specific needs. For example, you can set the "temperature" to make the responses more creative, or provide a "context" to guide the model's tone and style.

```python
# We can add parameters to our requests such as context, history, max_new_tokens, repetition_penalty, seed, temperature, top_k, top_p, truncate, typical_p
params = {
    "temperature": 0.9, 
    "max_new_tokens": 200,
    "context": "You are a first grade teacher that uses language and explanations easy for children to understand."
    }

# Pass your parameters as a dictionary to the ask method using the param_dict argument
new_answer = llama3_model.ask(question, param_dict=params)

print(new_answer['response'])
```

### Using Chat history

```python

# We can pass our own history to the ask method
# You can use as many dictionaries as you want in the history list but each one will add tokens to the request
history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": question},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": new_answer['response']}
]

# Here we change the context to a college professor and pass our chat history
params = {
    "temperature": 0.9, 
    "max_new_tokens": 200,
    "context": "You are college professor who provides complex answers backed by science.",
    "history": history
}

# Our new question references the chat history
new_question = "Can you explain your previous answer in more detail?"

new_answer = llama3_model.ask(new_question, params)

print(new_answer['response'])
```

## Using Vector Databases

When working with vector databases, you often need to add documents to the database so that it can store and retrieve information efficiently. A vector database uses vectors (arrays of numbers) to represent data, making it easier to search and analyze large datasets.

### Adding Documents

In this example, we use a FAISS vector engine to add documents to our database.

```python
from ai_server import VectorEngine

# Using a FAISS vector engine
vector_engine_id = 'DEV_VECTOR_ENGINE_ID'

# We initialize the VectorEngine object with the engine id and the current insight id
faiss_vector_engine = VectorEngine(engine_id=vector_engine_id, insight_id=server_connection.cur_insight)

file_path = "./ai-whitehouse.pdf"

# We can add documents to the faiss index with the addDocument method
faiss_vector_engine.addDocument(file_paths = [file_path])
```

### Listing Uploaded Documents

```python
# Fetch a list of uploaded documents
my_documents = faiss_vector_engine.listDocuments()

print(my_documents)
```

### Performing a Nearest Neighbor Search

```python
query = "How does the document define machine learning?"

# Find the closest match(es) between the question bassed in and the embedded documents using Euclidena Distance.
nearest_neighbor = faiss_vector_engine.nearestNeighbor(search_statement=query, limit = 3, insight_id = server_connection.cur_insight)

for index, result in enumerate(nearest_neighbor):
    print(f"Result {index + 1}")
    print(f"SCORE: {result['Score']}")
    print(f"TOKENS: {result['Tokens']}")
    print(f"CONTENT: {result['Content']}")
```

### Removing Documents

```python
# Names of the files we want to remove
file_names = ['ai-whitehouse.pdf']

faiss_vector_engine.removeDocument(file_names = file_names)

print(faiss_vector_engine.listDocuments())
```

## Using Databases

### Querying a Database

```python
from ai_server import DatabaseEngine

# An example H2 diabetes database
db_engine_id = 'DEV_DATABASE_ENGINE_ID'

# Connect to the database by passing the engine id and the current insight id
db = DatabaseEngine(engine_id=db_engine_id, insight_id=server_connection.cur_insight)

query = db.execQuery(query = "SELECT height, weight, location FROM diabetes WHERE height < 62 AND weight > 200")

print(query)
```

### Inserting Data

```python
insert = "INSERT INTO diabetes (height, weight, location) VALUES (65, 200, 'Rosslyn')"

# NOTE you will need to be an author or editor of the database to insert or delete data
db.insertData(query = insert)

query = db.execQuery(query = "SELECT height, weight, location FROM diabetes WHERE location = 'Rosslyn'")

print(query)
```

### Deleting Data

```python
remove = "DELETE FROM diabetes WHERE location = 'Rosslyn'"

db.removeData(query = remove)

query = db.execQuery(query = "SELECT height, weight, location FROM diabetes WHERE location = 'Rosslyn'")

print(query)
```

## Using Function Engines

A Function Engine is a powerful tool for executing specific functions in a modular, reusable, and scalable manner. It simplifies the process of integrating and managing functions within your application.

```python
from ai_server import FunctionEngine

# Weather function engine
weather_id = 'DEV_FUNCTION_ENGINE_ID'

function = FunctionEngine(engine_id=weather_id, insight_id=server_connection.cur_insight)

# Parameters will change based on the function you are using
output = function.execute({"lat":"37.540","lon":"77.4360"})

print(output)
```

## Using Storage Engines

Connect to storage resources in a centralized, scalable, and efficient manner. `StorageEngine` simplifies the process of listing files, retrieving their details, and performing other storage-related tasks.


### Listing files

```python
from ai_server import StorageEngine

# Example S3 bucket
storage_engine_id = 'DEV_STORAGE_ENGINE_ID'

storageEngine = StorageEngine(engine_id = storage_engine_id, insight_id = server_connection.cur_insight)

s3_storage_path = "/my-new-test-folder/"

# A list of the files in the given path
my_dir = storageEngine.list(storagePath = s3_storage_path)

for file in my_dir:
    print (f"-- {file}")

# A list of details about the files in the given path
my_dir_details = storageEngine.listDetails(storagePath = '/my-new-test-folder/')

for file_details in my_dir_details:
    print (f"-- {file_details}")
```

## Using Pixels

A **pixel** is a SEMOSS specific term that references a backend call. It is similar to a standardized API call, though it does not require you to specify the type of API call (i.e POST/PUT/GET/DELETE). The pixel call generally specifies a **reactor** that is being called, and then any input variables that the reactor needs. When discussing pixel calls in this documentation we will also include a sample of the pixel string structure required. 


```python
# You can use the active server connection to run pixels

simple_pixel_response = server_connection.run_pixel('1+1')

print('Simple Response --')
print(simple_pixel_response)

full_pixel_response = server_connection.run_pixel('1+1', full_response=True)

print('Full Response --')
print(full_pixel_response)
```

### Running a Pixel 

```python
from semoss import Insight
insight = Insight(${i})
insight.run_pixel(pixel="LLM ( engine = [ '4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172' ] , command = [ '<encode>What is the capital of Connecticut</encode>' ] )")
```

### LLM Chat with Pixels

```python
engine_id = 'DEV_LLM_CHAT_ENGINE_ID'

chat = server_connection.run_pixel(
    f"LLM ( engine = [ '{engine_id}' ] , command = [ '<encode>What is the capital of Connecticut</encode>' ] , paramValues = [ {{ 'max_new_tokens' : 200 , 'temperature' : 0.3 }} ] )"
)
print(chat)
```

// File: Integrating with SEMOSS\Packages and Pre-requisites

# Packages and Prerequisites for SEMOSS Apps

## Overview

In this section we will go through what front end and back end packages are necessary for most SEMOSS apps.

## Front End Prerequisities

For front end development the main prerequisities that you need are Node, pnpm, and the SEMOSS SDK.

### Node.js

You can install Node on your machine by downloading the appropriate installer for your device directly from the Node.js website. Version [v18.16.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.16.0/) is suggested for our projects (for most Windows machines, you should download `node-v18.16.0-x64.msi`).

### Code Editor

You'll need to have your code editor of choice downloaded on your machine. We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

### Installing PNPM

You should have Node installed, that will be our package manager of choice. There are instructions for how to install this in our Prerequisites portion.

You can check that they exist on your machine by typing the following code in a terminal.

```
    node -v
    npm -v
```

If these output versions, that means that you have a working version of npm on your computer. If you do not go back to prerequisities and make sure to download Node (and npm alongside it).

We will be using npm to install pnpm, which is a lighter package manager.

To do so open a terminal and install it using:

`npm install -g pnpm`

#### Installing the SEMOSS SDK

The SEMOSS SDK includes software-building tools for a connecting SEMOSS to a custom React app. To use the SDK, ensure you have node, node package manager, and code editor installed.

Use PNPM/NPM to install the following packages and add them to your project.

`npm install @SEMOSS/sdk-react`

`npm install @SEMOSS/sdk`

### Project Structure

For a deep dive into the directory structure of your project, see the [React App Technical Guide](../App%20Creation%20Guides/React%20App%20In-Depth%20Guide.md).

### Optional: Fully Local Front End Installation

You **do NOT need a fully local front end installation** to build apps that run on SEMOSS.

However, if you wish to contribute to the SEMOSS project or want visibility into the front end source code, please follow this guide: [Frontend Local Installation Guide](../../Advanced%20Installation/Frontend%20Installation.md)

## Back End Prerequisities

Please Note that these are only necessary if you are planning on running a local back end. The majority of projects do not need to do so. Please refer to the [Docker BE Install Guide](../../Advanced%20Installation/Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md) to see if you need to go through a back end installation.

### Back End Setup Overview

Though it is possible to develop apps solely with front end frameworks, SEMOSS allows you to incorporate custom back end logic using **Java** and **Python**. To get started with custom back end development, follow the [Java Setup](#java-setup) and [Python Setup](#python-setup) sections below.

**Optional - Web Server vs. Local Instance: Which should I choose?**

Next, choose whether you want to connect with the **web version** of SEMOSS, or if you want to run a **local instance** of SEMOSS instead.
Note that the primary way that most users will interact with the SEMOSS back end is through its **[live web server](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/#/)**. If you followed the previous section on [generating access and secret keys](./Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md#generating-access-and-secret-keys), then you already can access this web server.

However, if you wish to have **admin privileges** or **greater control of an SEMOSS instance**, you can choose to run the SEMOSS server locally. SEMOSS provides two methods to run a SEMOSS instance locally, which are:

1. [Docker Container](#optional-starting-the-dockerized-back-end)
2. [Fully Local Installation](#optional-fully-local-back-end-installation)

### Java Setup

- `%PYTHONHOME%`
- `%PYTHONHOME%\Scripts`

8. Click OK, the OK again to save the System Environment variables.
9. If you had any open IDEs or processes that use the `PATH` or `PYTHONHOME` variables, you will need to stop those processes and **restart them** to pull in the new paths.

#### Python Packages Available within SEMOSS

SEMOSS currently comes bundled with the packages in the below list.

You can choose to install the relevant packages for your project from the below list by running the following command:
`pip install PACKAGE_NAME==VERSION_NUMBER`
where `PACKAGE_NAME` and `VERSION_NUMBER` are replaced with the actual name and version of the package you wish to install.

> **Note** > _`pip` is a package manager for Python. It typically is automatically installed alongside Python. If you prefer to use a different package manager such as `conda` instead, please feel free to do so._
>
> If you encounter a `pip is not recognized as an internal or external command` or `pip: command not found` error, it means that you either:
>
> - **Do not have pip installed:**
>   - **Solution**: Navigate to the `Scripts` folder in your `%PYTHONHOME%` directory (ex. `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts`).
>
>     Confirm if there is a `pip` executable file in the directory.
>
>     If there is not, then please install `pip` by following this [guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).
> - **OR: Did not set your `%PYTHONHOME%\Scripts` path correctly in your System Environment variables:**
>
>   - **Solution**: Close your command line/terminal. Verify that the path you entered for your `%PYTHONHOME%` variable matches the path to your Python folder EXACTLY (ex. `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\`).
>
>     Double check that your `%PATH%` contains a `%PYTHONHOME%\Scripts` entry.
>
>     Relaunch a new command line and try to run the `pip install` command again.

After installing the packages, you can view where they are installed by navigating to the `Lib` folder within your `PYTHON_HOME` directory (ex: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Lib`).

### Using the SEMOSS SDK

#### SEMOSS SDK Environment Variables

Note: We recommend manually setting the environment only in development mode.

You can setup a development environment and use access keys to authenticate with the app server. Generate the keys on the server and then update the Env module. See:

```
// import the module
import { Env } from '@SEMOSS/sdk';

// update the environment
Env.update({
    /**
     * Url pointing to the app server
     **/
    MODULE: '',
    /**
     * Access key generated by the app server
     **/
    ACCESS_KEY: '',
    /**
     * Secret key generated by the app server
     **/
    SECRET_KEY: '',
    /**
     * Optional field. This will load app specific reactors into the insight. Your app has to be hosted and running on the app server.
     **/
    APP: '',
});
```

> **Important** > _Please do not commit your keys, and do not place your keys in the `.env` file. Instead, externalize your keys to a `.env.local` file and load them in as environment variables during development. Additionally, **do not allow Git to track your `.env.local` file!** Your keys are SECRET, so you do not want to expose them by committing them to Git._

#### Powering Your App with Custom Python

The app server allows you to write custom Python to power your app. You can initialize your Python environment by:

**Loading via a file**

The SDK will load Python via an external file.

```
# ./hello.py
def sayHello(name):
    print(f'Hello {name}')
Set the option on initialize:
// import the module
import { Env } from '@SEMOSS/sdk';

// update the environment
insight.initialize({
    python: {
        /**
         *  Load the python via an external file
         **/
        type: 'file',
        /**
         *  Path to the file
         **/
        path: './hello.py',
        /**
         *  Alias for the file
         **/
        alias: 'smss',
    },
});
```

**Loading via js**

The SDK will load Python via an external file.

```
# ./hello.py

Set the option on initialize:
// import the module
import { Env } from '@SEMOSS/sdk';

// define it int he js
const py = `
def sayHello(name):
    printf('Hello {name}')
`;

// update the environment
insight.initialize({
    python: {
        /**
         *  Load the python via js
         **/
        type: 'script',
        /**
         *  Path to the file
         **/
        script: py,
        /**
         *  Alias for the file
         **/
        alias: 'smss',
    },
});

```

Next you can run the preloaded Python methods by calling the runPy action, like in the below example:

```
const hello = (name) => {
    const { pixelReturn } = await insight.actions.runPy(
        `smss.sayHello(${name})`,
    );

    // get the data
    const data = pixelReturn[0].output;

    console.log(data);
};
```

### Optional: Starting the Dockerized Back End

For users who wish to have **admin privileges** or want to host a **private instance** of SEMOSS, SEMOSS has made it possible for users to run SEMOSS locally by packaging its back end into a **Docker image**. The Docker image allows users to quickly start running SEMOSS inside of a container. To run the back end, please follow this guide: [Docker BE Install Guide](../../Advanced%20Installation/Docker%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md)

If you need **even greater control** over SEMOSS, including the ability to directly modify core SEMOSS source code or to bring your own dependencies, please follow the instructions in the next section (Optional: Fully Local Back End Installation).

### Optional: Fully Local Back End Installation

You **do NOT need to do a full local installation** in order to run SEMOSS locally. For most users, it is sufficient to simply download **Java** and **Python**, and then run the back end in a **Docker container** as noted in the previous section.

However, if you wish to **contribute to the SEMOSS project** or want **visibility into the back end source code**, please follow the instructions in this guide: [Local BE Install Guide](../../Advanced%20Installation/Local%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md).

// File: Integrating with SEMOSS\Using the SDK

# Using the SEMOSS SDK

## Overview 

The SEMOSS SDK (Software Developer Kit) gives you access to the data that you have stored inside of your SEMOSS instance. It also allows you to make pixel calls, login, and query LLMs. 

- [Using the SEMOSS SDK](#using-the-semoss-sdk)
- [SEMOSS Environment Variables](#environment-variables)
- [Using Insights](#using-insights)
- [Using Pixels](#using-pixels)
    - [Retrieving Models](#retrieving-models)
    - [Calling a LLM](#querying-a-large-language-model)
    - [Running a Database Query](#running-a-database-query)
    - [Logging In](#logging-in)
    - [Logging Out](#logging-out)


### Using the SEMOSS SDK
In order to use the SEMOSS SDK, you will need to populate your SEMOSS instance with models, storage catalogs, and databases for use in your project. Learn how to do that in [Navigating SEMOSS](../../Get%20Started/Navigation).

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required at the root level of your client directory. They should be defined in `.env` and `.env.local` files. `.env.local` will not already exist in the project and will need to be created. Set the `ACCESS_KEY` and `SECRET_KEY` variables in `.env.local` to be the [access and secret keys](./Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md#generating-access-and-secret-keys) you generated to connect to SEMOSS.

![Screenshot of .env and .env.local file contents](../../static/img/FELocalInstall/env.png)

> **Note**
> _The `.env.local` file will appear greyed out. This is because it will be ignored by Git, so the file will not be pushed up with the rest of your work. It is important to avoid tracking this file in Git or pushing its changes to a repository since it was create to contain your access and secret keys._

The example `.env` above demonstrates how you would set your environment variables to connect to the SEMOSS server. To connect to a local instance instead, use the following variables:
```
    MODULE=/Monolith_Dev
    ENDPOINT=http://localhost:9090
    APP=<APP_ID>
```
You can access the `APP_ID` after you host the app in SEMOSS. Your `APP_ID` will be an alphanumerical string at the end of the app URL. 

For example, if the app URL is:
`http://localhost:9090/SEMOSS-ui/packages/client/dist/#/app/75277e50-456e-43f8-8ad7-d03224ebe4da`
then the `APP_ID` would be `75277e50-456e-43f8-8ad7-d03224ebe4da`

You can access the app URL by going to the App Library, navigating to the hosted app, and copying the link from the URL bar in your browser. 

#### Using Insights

`InsightProvider` is a wrapper component and provide an [Insight](../../Get%20Started/Key%20Concepts.md#what-is-an-insight) to all of its children. 
In your base app, use the insight provider like so:

```
import { InsightProvider } from '@SEMOSS/sdk-react';

const App = (props) => {
    const { children } = props;

    return <InsightProvider>{children}</InsightProvider>;
};
```

Once the application is wrapped, you can access insights through the useInsight hook.

```
import { useInsight } from '@SEMOSS/sdk-react';

const Child = (props) => {
    const { children } = props;

    const {
        /** Track if it is initialized **/
        isInitialized,
        /** Track if the user is authorized **/ isAuthorized,
        /** Any Insight Errors **/
        error,
        /** System information **/
        system,
        /** Actions to update **/
        actions,
    } = useInsight();

    return <InsightProvider>{children}</InsightProvider>;
};
```

#### Using Pixels
you can access it by using `pixel` API calls. Pixel is a domain-specific language used by SEMOSS to access and update data. Below are some examples of how to use a pixel call.

##### Retrieving Models
```
const { actions } = useInsight();

const pixel = `MyEngines( engineTypes=["MODEL"]);`
actions.run(pixel)
    .then((response) => {
        const { output, operationType } = response.pixelReturn[0];
        if (operationType.indexOf('ERROR') > -1) {
            throw new Error(output as string)
        }
        if (Array.isArray(output)) {
            console.log(output) // log the models returned
        }
    })
``` 

##### Querying a Large Language Model
```
const { actions } = useInsight();

const ask = (question) => {
    const { pixelReturn } = await actions.run(
        `LLM(engine=["${ENGINE}"], command=["<encode>${question}</encode>"]);`,
    );

    // get the message
    const message = pixelReturn[0].output.response;
    console.log(message);
};
```

##### Running a Database Query
SEMOSS Platform provides 2 main ways to query a database.
- Generic Pixel Query syntax: This is SEMOSS specific querying syntax which is database agnostic.
- Native Database Query: This is the way to query based on the native database querying language/dialect.

By using the Generic Pixel Query syntax, you can specify:
- Select(...)
- Filter(...)
- Sort(...)
- Limit(...)
- Offset(...)

For our movie database here is an example:
Database ( database = [ `"<ENGINE_ID>"` ] ) | Select ( MOVIES__Title ) .as ( [ Title ] ) | Filter ( ( ( MOVIES__Genre == [ "Action-Adventure" , "Comedy-Musical" , "Drama" ] )  AND  ( MOVIES__MovieBudget >= [ 10000 ] ) ) ) | Distinct ( false ) | CollectAll();

This query is selecting all the movie titles that have a MovieBudget greater than 10000 and specific genre.

> _**Note** When you want to specify a column in a table in the query, you must use the form TABLENAME__COLUMN. Pixel syntax is case sensitive!

To run a Native Database Pixel query, you can add your query to this pixel:
Database ( database = [ `"<ENGINE_ID>"` ] ) | Query ( "<encode>select * from MOVIES limit 10;</encode>" ) | CollectAll();
> _**Note** Your database query may be case sensitive!

```
const { actions } = useInsight();

const getMovies = () => {
    const { pixelReturn } = await actions.query(
        `Database(engine=["${ENGINE}"]) | Select(Movie__Title, Movie__Year) | Collect(-1)`,
    );

    // get the data
    const data = pixelReturn[0].output;

    console.log(data);
};
```
> _**Note** For more guidance on the syntax of LLM and database queries, please review the SEMOSS User Guide **[here](https://semoss.org/SemossDocumentation/#scripting-understanding-pixel)**._

##### Logging In
```
const { actions } = useInsight();

const login = (username, password) => {
    const success = await actions.login({
        type: 'native',
        username: username,
        password: password,
    });

    console.log(success);
};

const loginWithOauth = (provider: 'ms' ) => {
    const resp = await insight.actions.login({
        type: 'oauth',
        provider: provider
    })

    console.log(resp)
}
```

##### Logging Out
```
const { actions } = useInsight();

const logout = (username, password) => {
    const success = await actions.logout();

    console.log(success);
};
```

#### Ask LLM with stream  

```
import { partial, runPixel } from '@semoss/sdk';

const insight = new Insight();
await insight.initialize()
const insightId = insight._store.insightId

const askWithStream = async () => {
        let isCollecting = false;

        const collectMessage = async () => {
            // only continue if response hasn't come back from runPixel
            if (!isCollecting) {
                return;
            }
    
            // get the output of partial
            try {
                const output = await partial(insightId);

                // add the partial
                if (output.message && output.message.total) {
                    setAnswer(output.message.total);
                }

                // get the next partial of response
                setTimeout(() => collectMessage(), 1000);
            } catch (e) {
                // noop
            }
        }

        // start collecting
        isCollecting = true;
        
        // initial delay that collects partial of response
        setTimeout(() => collectMessage(), 500);

        const { errors, pixelReturn } = await runPixel(
            `LLM(engine=["001510f8-b86e-492e-a7f0-41299775e7d9"], command=["<encode>${question}</encode>"]);`,
            insightId,
        );

         // OR

        // const response = await  insight.actions.run(
        //     `LLM(engine=[MODEL_ID], command=["<encode>${question}</encode>"]);`,
        //     insightId,
        // )

        isCollecting = false
    }
```

# Utilizing AI Core Models through OpenAI APIs

## 1. Overview

OpenAI is one of the pioneering companies within the AI landscape. As such, most packages ensure integration with the OpenAI API. Therefore, we have decided to follow suit and allow any AI Core Model Engines to be accessed via the OpenAI API.

We supposrt the following endpoints listed on the OpenAI website:

- [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api)
- [Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/completions-api)
- [Embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings)

## 2. Installation Guide

### Generate Access Key from your AI Platform

The first step to gaining access to the data stored in your SEMOSS platform is to generate an access key and a secret key. To do this, click on the link below. After you have generated your keys, navigate back to this guide.

[Generate Access Key](./Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md#generating-access-and-secret-keys)

### Install the OpenAI and AI Platform Packages

A [new OpenAI Python](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/discussions/742) library was recently released. We provide examples of how to use the current major version (openai >= 1.0.0) and the old major version (openai \<= 0.28.1).

Open up a command prompt or terminal.
Then, run the following commands to install OpenAI Python API library and AI Platform Python library:

##### openai

```
pip install openai
pip install --upgrade ai-server-sdk
```

##### openai \<= 0.28.1

```
pip install openai<=0.28.1
pip install --upgrade ai-server-sdk
```

> **Note**
> This guide assumes that you already have Python (3.9+) and pip installed. If you do not, please follow the [Back End Setup](../../Advanced%20Installation/Local%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md) section first.

## 3. Using the AI Platform Endpoints with openai

In this walkthrough we will use existing code from the above endpoints and modify it to work with the AI Platform.

### Step 3.1: **Create a connection to the AI Platform**

Every api call that is made usually requires some level of authentication. First we store our credentials so that they only have to be passed once.

**Please note**: This step is required before moving to any other step.

```python
# import the ai platform package
import ai_server

# pass in your access and secret keys to authenticate
server_connection=ai_server.RESTServer(
    access_key="<your access key>",             
    secret_key="<your secret key>",            
    base="<your monolith api endpoint>"         # example: https://{domain}/{direcotry/path segment}/Monolith/api
)
```

### Step 3.2: **Change the default OpenAI endpoint to AI Platform OpenAI endpoint**

This Python code modifies the default endpoint in openai client and sets an API key. The API key is not required but the package requires one to be set.

```python
# import the openai package
from openai import OpenAI
import httpx as httpx
http_client = httpx.Client()
http_client.cookies=server_connection.cookies

# Modify OpenAI's API key and API base to use CFG's API.
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="EMPTY",
    base_url=server_connection.get_openai_endpoint(),
    default_headers=server_connection.get_auth_headers(),
    http_client=http_client
)
```

### Step 3.3: **Modifying the Code**

We are going to modify the existing examples for each of the endpoints above.

#### Chat Completions

```python
# original code
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ]
)

# modified code
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="2c6de0ff-62e0-4dd0-8380-782ac4d40245", # change the model name to a Model Engine ID
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
    ],
    extra_body={"insight_id":server_connection.cur_insight} # add the insight_id as an extra param
)
```

#### Completions

```python
# original code
response = client.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", # change the model name to a Model Engine ID
    prompt="Write a tagline for an ice cream shop."
)

# modified code
response = client.completions.create(
    model="4801422a-5c62-421e-a00c-05c6a9e15de8", # change the model name to a Model Engine ID
    prompt="Write a tagline for an ice cream shop.",
    extra_body={"insight_id":server_connection.cur_insight} # add the insight_id as an extra param
)
```

#### Embeddings

```python
# original code
client.embeddings.create(
    input=["Your text string goes here"],
    model="text-embedding-ada-002",
)

# modified code
client.embeddings.create(
    input=["Your text string goes here"],
    model="cb661f04-cb30-48fd-aafc-b4d422ce24e4",
    extra_body={"insight_id":server_connection.cur_insight} # add the insight_id as an extra param
)
```

### 4 Langchain with openai

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.prompts.chat import (
    ChatPromptTemplate,
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate,
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate,
)
from langchain.schema import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

import httpx as httpx
http_client = httpx.Client()
http_client.cookies=server_connection.cookies

chat = ChatOpenAI(
    api_key="EMPTY",
    base_url=server_connection.get_openai_endpoint(),
    default_headers=server_connection.get_auth_headers(),
    extra_body={"insight_id":server_connection.cur_insight},
    http_client=http_client,
    model="2c6de0ff-62e0-4dd0-8380-782ac4d40245",
)

messages = [
    SystemMessage(
        content="You are a helpful assistant that translates English to French."
    ),
    HumanMessage(
        content="Translate this sentence from English to French. I love programming."
    ),
]
print(chat(messages))
```

// File: Reactors\General\index

# SEMOSS General Reactor Documentation

This document provides comprehensive documentation for SEMOSS reactor classes that extend AbstractReactor and override the getReactorDescription() method.

## Reactor Categories

- [Core Reactors](./Reactors/core-reactors) - Basic echo and utility reactors
- [Model & AI Reactors](./Reactors/model-ai-reactors) - LLM and AI-powered reactors
- [Project Management](./Reactors/project-management) - Project loading and dependency management
- [Browser Automation](./browser-automation) - Web browser interaction reactors
- [Utility Reactors](./utility-reactors) - Date, file compression, and execution control
- [Admin Reactors](./admin-reactors) - System administration reactors

## Common Patterns

### Parameter Types
- **String values** - Most parameters accept string values
- **Boolean values** - Use `true`/`false` or `"true"`/`"false"`
- **Maps** - Use object notation `{key: value, key2: value2}`
- **Arrays/Lists** - Use array notation `["item1", "item2"]`

### Error Handling
- Reactors will throw `IllegalArgumentException` for invalid parameters
- Security-related reactors will validate user permissions
- Admin reactors require admin privileges

### Security Considerations
- User permissions are validated for database/project access
- Anonymous users may be restricted from certain operations
- Admin-only reactors require elevated privileges

// File: Reactors\General\core-reactors

# Core Reactors

Core reactors provide basic functionality for echoing and returning values, primarily used for testing and debugging purposes.

## EchoReactor

**Description:** Returns back the input the user enters without modification.

**Purpose:** Used to echo or return back values that are passed to it for testing or debugging purposes.

### Required Inputs
- **value** - The value to echo back

### Usage Examples
```javascript
Echo(value="Hello World")
Echo("Hello World")
```

---

## EchoEReactor

**Description:** Returns back the encoded input the user enters with URI decoding.

**Purpose:** Used to echo or return back URI-decoded values that are passed to it.

### Required Inputs
- **value** - The value to echo back (will be URI decoded)

### Usage Examples
```javascript
EchoE(value="Hello World")
EchoE("Hello%20World")  // Will decode to "Hello World"
```

---

// File: Reactors\General\model-ai-reactors

# Model & AI Reactors

Model and AI reactors provide interfaces for interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI-powered text generation capabilities.

## LLMReactor

**Description:** Used to run an LLM text-generation call.

**Purpose:** Provides an interface to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation tasks, with support for context, history, and parameter customization.

### Required Inputs
- **engine** - The model engine ID to use for the LLM call
- **command** - The prompt to execute against the LLM

### Optional Inputs
- **context** - The system prompt to use for the LLM call
- **use_history** - Boolean true/false to determine if chat history should be incorporated (default: true)
- **param_values_map** - Map containing model parameters like 'temperature', 'top_p', etc.

### Usage Examples
```javascript
LLM(engine="myModel", command="What is machine learning?")
LLM(engine="myModel", command="Explain AI", context="You are a helpful assistant", use_history=false)
LLM(engine="myModel", command="Generate text", param_values_map={temperature: 0.7, top_p: 0.9})
```

---

## LLM2Reactor

**Description:** Used to run an enhanced LLM text-generation call with advanced features.

**Purpose:** Provides an improved interface to interact with Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation tasks, with support for images, files, context, history, and parameter customization.

### Required Inputs
- **engine** - The model engine ID to use for the LLM call
- **command** - The prompt to execute against the LLM

### Optional Inputs
- **context** - The system prompt or context to use for the LLM call
- **use_history** - Boolean to determine if chat history should be incorporated
- **param_values_map** - Map containing model parameters like 'temperature', 'top_p', etc.
- **images** - List of images to include in the LLM call for vision models
- **files** - List of files to process as part of the request
- **room_id** - Room identifier for conversation context

### Usage Examples
```javascript
LLM2(engine="myModel", command="What is machine learning?")
LLM2(engine="visionModel", command="Describe this image", images=["image1.jpg"])
LLM2(engine="myModel", command="Analyze this", files=["data.csv"], use_history=false)
```

# Pixel

## Overview

Pixel is a domain specific language (DSL) specific to SEMOSS that is used as the payload for all the operations that can be performed on an insight. Every Pixel has a java class to handle the business logic on the backend, we call this java class a "Reactor".

## How to write a Pixel Call

A Pixel call has some important components:

1. PixelCommand the name of the pixel logic to execute
2. Inputs
   1. Inputs may use keys to define them
      ```
      AddColumn(newCol=["ColA"], dataType=["VARCHAR(50)"]);
      ```
   2. If PixelCommands do not use keys, then the order of the inputs is important!
      ```
       POWER(2, 3);
       POWER(3, 2);
      ```
3. Some Pixel commands use pipes (“|”). A pipe is used to indicate that you would like to chain a Pixel command with a previous one. Essentially, the output of one reactor is taken and put into the next reactor so that the Pixel commands build off of each other.
4. Finally, a semi-colon (“;”)! A semicolon is a terminator and will be found at the end of your chain of commands. A semicolon indicates that you want to create a sink. It is best to create a sink when you are at a logical endpoint, meaning you do not need to use the output of your command for another reactor. For example, a logical endpoint is when you want to push your data to the frontend of SEMOSS so that it can be viewed.

#### Example Pixel Call
```plaintext
CreateModelEngine(model="MyModel", modelDetails="details") | CreateStorageEngine(model="MyStorage", modelDetails="details") | CreateVectorDatabaseEngine(database="MyDatabase", conDetails="details", filePaths="path") ;
```

To run a pixel call, you can use the [terminal](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/SemossWeb/#!/embed-terminal).



## List of Useful Pixel Calls

There are many pixels calls/commands available that allows us to perform various kinds of tasks. To get a comprehensive list of all available Pixel commands, simply type `Help()` into the console.
![Help](../../../static/img/Pixel%20Calls/Help1.PNG)

### Common Pixel Calls

#### Engines

- **CreateModelEngine():** This allows you to setup and configure a new LLM into your backend. You can specify the type of model and other details using 2 input parameters.

  - _Input 0:_ `model` - Fill in the name/ engine ID of the model you want to use within ("").
  - _Input 1:_ `modelDetails` - Provide the map or collection of data that speciifes details to establish connection with the model engine within (""), each element separated by a coma(,).

- **CreateStorageEngine():** This allows you to setup and configure a new storage engine into your backend. You can specify the type of storage and other details using 2 input parameters.

  - _Input 0:_ `model` - Fill in the name/ engine ID of the storage you want to use within ("").
  - _Input 1:_ `modelDetails` - Provide the map or collection of data that speciifes details to access and interact with the storage engine within (""), each element separated by a coma(,).

- **CreateVectorDatabaseEngine():** This allows you to setup and configure a new vector database engine into your backend. You can specify the type of storage and other details using 2 input parameters.
  - _Input 0:_ `database` - Fill in the name/ engine ID of the database you want to use within ("").
  - _Input 1:_ `conDetails` - Provide the map or collection of data that speciifes details to establish connection with the database within (""), each element separated by a coma(,).
  - _Input 2:_ `filePaths` - Any additional around file paths that may be required.

#### GenAI

- **CreateEmbeddingsFromDocuments()** This allows you to generate embeddings from data or documents that are already stored in your backend.

  - _Input 0:_ `engine` - Fill in the name/ engine ID that you want to use for embedding data within ("").
  - _Input 1:_ `filePaths` - Provide the file path or data sources from which you want to create embeddings within ("").
  - _Input 2:_ `paramValues` - Depending on the engine that you're using, you might have to specify additional parameters or options within ("") separating each parameter/option by a coma(,).

- **LLM():** This allows you to run query on any chosen LLM and interact with the underlying workspace.
  - _Input 0:_ `engine` - Fill in the name/ engine ID of the model you want to run your queries on within ("").
  - _Input 1:_ `command` - Provide the query or command than you want to execute within ("").
  - _Input 2:_ `context`- Specify the directory for running the queries within("").
  - _Input 3:_ `paramValues` - Define parameter names and their corresponding values within ("") separating each parameter by a coma(,).

#### Accessing Data

- **Database():** This allows you to specify the database that you want to use or identify it as a different variable, example `X = Database ()`.

  - _Input 0:_ `engine` - Fill in the name/ engine ID of the database you want to refer within ("").

- **Frame():** This allows you to specify and define a frame/ container for organizing and arranging your data into tables, charts, and other visual formats.

  - _Input 0:_ `frame` - Provide the name/ ID of the frame that you want to work with within ("").

- **Insert():** This allows you to insert or add data, values, or text into something.
  - _Input 0:_ `into` - Specify the target or destination where you want to insert any value or data.
  - _Input 1:_ `values` - Provide the numeric or string values that you want to insert to be used as input
  - _Input 2:_ `commit` - To commit or finalize the insertion.
  - _Input 3:_ `customSuccessMessage` - You can define a custom success message that will be displayed after the insertion is successfully completed

#### Running scripts

- **Py():** This allows you to run custom Python scripts in your backend. This command does not require specific input keys, typically included in the script itself.

- **Command():** This allows you to execute shell commands within your backend.
  - _Input 0:_ `command` - Provide the command that you want to run. Commands supported are
    - `cd`
    - `dir`
    - `ls`
    - `copy`
    - `cp`
    - `mv`
    - `move`
    - `del <specific file>`
    - `rm <specific file>`
    - `git`

#### API Calls

- **PostRequest():** This allows you to send a POST request to a specified URL.

  - _Input 0:_ `url` - Provide the URL to which yo want to send the POST request.
  - _Input 1:_ `headersMap` - Provide the map map containing key-value pairs the send in the headers in the POST request.
  - _Input 2:_ `bodyMap` - Provide the map map containing key-value pairs the send in the body of the POST request.
  - _Input 3:_ `useApplicationCert` - Use a boolean value to indicate whether the default application certificate should be used when making the POST request.

- **GetRequest():** This allows you to send a GET request to a specified URL.

  - _Input 0:_ `url` - Provide the URL to which yo want to send the GET request.
  - _Input 1:_ `headersMap` - Provide the map map containing key-value pairs the send in the headers in the GET request.
  - _Input 2:_ `useApplicationCert` - Use a boolean value to indicate whether the default application certificate should be used when making the GET request.
  - _Input 3:_ `saveFile` - Use a boolean value if you expect the request to return a file, and whether you want to save the file in your the insight space.

- **SendEmail():** This allows you to send emails from one recipient to the other. You can learn more about the inputs for this command using `--help` function.

### How to use Help Function

To understand the pixel calls/commands and their input options, you can run the `--help` function.

1. Type the name of the command you're interested in, followed by two hyphens and the word **help**. - For example, to know about the input options for **CreateModelEngine** command, you'd enter `CreateModelEngine --help` in the console.
   ![Help1](../../../static/img/Pixel%20Calls/help2.png)

2. You can see all the **Inputs** listed in the console output.

# Creating and Running a Custom Reactor


## Overview

A reactor is a business logic unit of **[Pixel](../../Java%20Development/java/pixels)** which performs the desired operation for the user. At its core, a reactor is just a Java class file. A reactor file is put inside a java folder within the App folder when custom backend code is required. It can directly interact with the SEMOSS server.

Example

```
package test;
import prerna.reactor.AbstractReactor;
import prerna.sablecc2.om.PixelDataType;
import prerna.sablecc2.om.nounmeta.NounMetadata;

public class NewReactor extends AbstractReactor {

    @Override
    public NounMetadata execute() {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        return null;
    }
}
```

As shown above, it is a simple custom reactor which just print out **"Hello World"**. It inherits from parent class reactor called **Abstract reactor** which uses a common implementation method for subclass reactors for them to operate. We are using **execute** in this case for our custom reactor to implement.

Based on the requirements, logic (lines after execute) can be simple, as in the above example, or complex.

## Prerequisites

### Install Maven
**Maven** is a dependency management tool for Java projects. When creating custom reactors, you will borrow classes and methods from a **SEMOSS** source that SEMOSS maintains through its [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.semoss/semoss). 

Please make sure that you have already set up SEMOSS and installed Maven according to one of the guides below based on your chosen setup type:
* **If you use the public SEMOSS server or Dockerized SEMOSS (common)**: [Getting Started: Maven Setup](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/#:~:text=Sections%201%20What%20is%20Maven%3F%202%20How%20can,8%20What%20is%20a%20SNAPSHOT%20version%3F%20More%20items)
* **If you use a fully local installation***: [Download Required Software](../../Advanced%20Installation/Local%20BE%20Install%20Guide.md)

  _*Fully local installations are uncommon and typically only recommended for users who wish to directly modify the SEMOSS source code._

### Create your package directory structure
1. To get started, navigate to the `java` folder inside of your app project folder. If you have not created an app project folder yet, please review the project directory structure [here](/How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/React%20App%20In-Depth%20Guide#app-structure) first.
2. Create the following unique identifiers using **lowercase a-z characters only**:

   - **Group ID**: This identifier represents your organization/team or who you are.
   - **Artifact ID**: This represents your project name.

     For example, if you work for the Human Resources team and are developing a Staffing App, you could choose "humanresources" as your group ID and "staffingapp" as your artifact ID.

3. Download the starter Maven project from [here](../../../static/assets/CustomReactorGuide.zip)
4. Once it's downloaded, unzip the folder. Open the `CustomReactorGuide` folder. You should see a folder inside it called `yourartifactid`.
5. Move the `yourartifactid` folder into the `java` folder within your project directory.
6. Rename the `yourartifactid` folder to the Artifact ID you chose earlier (ex. "staffingapp"). Make sure you type the name in lowercase a-z only (no spaces, underscores, or dashes).
7. Navigate inside the Artifact ID folder that you just renamed. You should see a `src` folder and a file titled `pom.xml`.
8. Open up `pom.xml` in any text editor to replace any instances of `yourgroupid` and `yourartifactid`. These usually occur around lines 5-8:

  ```
   5 	 <groupId>yourgroupid</groupId>
   6	 <artifactId>yourartifactid</artifactId>
   7	 <version>0.1</version>
   8	 <name>yourartifactid</name>
   ```

   Replace `yourgroupid` on line 5 with the actual group ID you chose in the previous section.
   Replace `yourartifactid` on lines 6 and 8 with the actual artifact ID you chose in the previous section. **Save and close the file.**

   > **Note**
   > If you want to use your own `pom.xml` for your project instead of our starter template, simply add the following snippet to the `dependencies` block:
   
    ```
    <!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.semoss/semoss -->
    <dependency>
       <groupId>org.semoss</groupId>
       <artifactId>semoss</artifactId>
       <version>4.2.2</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
 
9. Navigate into the `src/main/java` folder. You should see a folder titled `yourgroupid`
10. Rename the `yourgroupid` folder as the Group ID (ex. "humanresources"). Make sure you type the name in lowercase a-z only (no spaces, underscores, or dashes).
11. Navigate inside the Group ID folder that you just renamed, where you will see another folder named `yourartifactid`. Rename this folder according to the Artifact ID you chose earlier.
12. Return to the `src` folder and navigate into the `src/test/java` folder. Repeat steps 10-11 inside this folder as well.

### Recommended: Import your Project into your IDE

Most popular IDEs that support Java will also provide Maven extensions and easy workflows to import and build Maven projects. Please check out the following IDE-specific guides on how to **import an existing Maven project** into your preferred IDE.

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-build)
- [Eclipse](https://www.baeldung.com/maven-import-eclipse)
- [JetBrains/IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/maven-support.html)

## CustomReactor Guide

> **Note**
> In this guide, we will walk through creating a reactor called `CustomReactor`. You can choose to name your reactor something else, but please keep in mind the following naming conventions:
>
> - The first letter of the name is capitalized.
> - The name of the class ends in `Reactor`. For example, `LLMReactor`, `MyFavoriteReactor`.
> - The pixel call that initiates the reactor is case-sensitive and is determined by what comes before "Reactor" in the name. For example, if you create a reactor called `TalkReactor`, then the corresponding pixel call is `Talk()`

### Start with a Reactor Template

1. In your preferred IDE, open up the `java/yourartifactid` folder as your project directory/workspace.
2. View the CustomReactor.java file located at `java/yourartifactid/src/main/java/yourgroupid/yourartifactid/reactor` in your IDE. The first line looks like:

   `package yourgroupid.yourartifactid.reactor;`

   Replace the value of `yourgroupid` and `yourartifactid` with the actual identifiers that you chose in the previous section.

3. View the CustomReactorTest.java file located at `java/yourartifactid/src/test/java/yourgroupid/yourartifactid` in your IDE. The first line looks like:

   `package yourgroupid.yourartifactid`

Replace the value of `yourgroupid` and `yourartifactid` with the actual identifiers that you chose in the previous section.

### Test your Maven Integration

1. If you are using an IDE with Maven integration **(recommended)**, use your IDE's Maven utilities to **clean** the Maven project, **update/validate** it, and **compile or package** it.
2. If not, then open up a command prompt/terminal and `cd` to your `java/yourartifactid` folder. Then, run the following commands and ensure that Maven outputs a **"BUILD SUCCESS"** message after each command.
   - `mvn clean`
   - `mvn validate`
   - `mvn package`
     
### Try out the CustomReactor

Return to the CustomReactor.java file. Note the lines:

```
    final static String NAME_INPUT_STRING = "name";

    public CustomReactor() {
        this.keysToGet = new String[] { NAME_INPUT_STRING };
    }
```

The **`keysToGet`** field is a list of inputs the reactor should accept. These input argument names are stored as a String array.
For the CustomReactor example, we have specified that the reactor should have one input field which is **"name"**.

Then, the next block of code in the `execute()` method provides the instructions for what the reactor should do.

```
    @Override
    public NounMetadata execute() {
        organizeKeys();
        String userName = this.keyValue.get(NAME_INPUT_STRING);
        String message = "Hello " + userName + "!";
        return new NounMetadata(message, PixelDataType.CONST_STRING);
    }
```

In this case, CustomReactor will return a String that says "Hello YOUR_USERNAME!", where YOUR_USERNAME represents a name that was received from the user inputs.

To confirm that the reactor actually works, open up the CustomReactorTest.java file located at `java/yourartifactid/src/test/java/yourgroupid/yourartifactid` in your preferred IDE. If you are working with an IDE that has **JUnit integration**, you can run the test and verify that the reactor output matches the expected string "Hello YOUR_USERNAME!"

## Coding Your Own Reactor

To create your own reactor, you need to define what user inputs the reactor needs and to specify these as the `keysToGet`.

```
public CustomReactor() {
       this.keysToGet = new String[] {"firstName", "lastName", "age"}
}
```

As shown in the above example, there are 3 input arguments indicating that the reactor expects to receive a "firstName", "lastName", and "age".

You can put any number of input arguments, and you can also specify whether these arguments should be **required** or **optional**.

These input values will be passed into the reactor through a pixel call, which is run in the SEMOSS terminal. When we enter inputs using a pixel call, it identifies which Java reactor to interact with using those inputs.

### How data is passed into a reactor

Each reactor has a NounStore Object, under the variable name store.

What is a **NounStore**?  
It is a collection of keys pointing to another object, called a **GenRowStruct**.

What is a **GenRowStruct**?  
It is a vector which stores inputs as **NounMetadata** objects.

What is a **NounMetadata**?  
It is a wrapper around any Object value, PixelDataType nounType.

The store will hold all the information that is passed into the reactor, but based on how the information is sent, it will store it in different locations. Upon reactor initialization, an empty GenRowStruct is created.

### Override execute() method

Just like creating any other reactor, we will override the `execute()` method from **AbstractReactor**. We want to end this method by returning the NounMetadata results from the reactor we called here, so it also gets returned to the user when this reactor is used. First run the User input 1 string, followed by User input 2 string and then the third User input and so on as shown below and it will execute the actions.

```
    @Override
    public NounMetadata execute() {
        organizeKeys();
        String firstName = this.keyValue.get("firstName");
        String lastName = this.keyValue.get("lastName");
        String age = this.keyValue.get("age");

        String greeting = "Hello, " + firstName + " " + lastName + "! You are " + age + " years old."

        return new NounMetadata(greeting, PixelDataType.CONST_STRING);

    }
```

Here, we override the `execute()` method to take in the **"firstName"**, **"lastName"**, and **"age"** keys passed in to return a greeting message. If I run the reactor call `CustomReactor("John", "Doe", "30")`, the reactor will return **"Hello, John Doe! You are 30 years old."**.

Put the Reactor file in inside Java folder within the App folder for App to be used.

### Extending What Your Reactor Can Do

In the above example, notice that the top of the reactor file has some import statements, like:

```
import prerna.sablecc2.reactor.AbstractReactor;
import prerna.sablecc2.om.PixelDataType;
import prerna.sablecc2.om.nounmeta.NounMetadata;
```

These import statements refer to classes that SEMOSS provides through its [Maven Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.semoss/semoss). There are many more SEMOSS classes, including (at least 987) reactors, that you can "borrow" by importing into your own code as shown above. Utilizing SEMOSS's classes can supercharge the range of different functions that your reactor can perform.

## Validating and Testing a Reactor

1. Now that a custom reactor has been coded/developed, the next step is to add the reactor to your java folder and test it using the **Editor**.

   For that, open the SEMOSS server and and click on **BI** in App Library as shown below.
   ![BI](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/InsideBI.PNG)

   > _BI in App Library_

2. Next, under My Insights - click Create + New Project.
   ![ProjectButton](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/AddNewProjectButton.PNG)

3. Mark your project as private and provide it with any name (Note: This is for your personal use). Select your project under the insight tab and copy the ID from the URL.
   ![ProjectPanel](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/CreateNewProjectPanel.PNG)

4. Now on the left nav bar, click on **Add New Insight**. Then, go to the **CFG Terminal** (next to the Save button) and click **Editor** as Mode and then **Project** as your workspace. Please select your project that you created in step 3 from the dropdown. Enter your **version** -> **assets** folder. Create a java folder, a py folder, and a portals folder. Upload your reactors in the java folder. Upload any python files that your reactors use in the py file. Whenever you change your reactor or python file delete it from this directory and re-upload.
   ![CreateJavaFolder](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/CreatingJavaFolder.PNG)

5. Run the following commands to test your reactors:

- `ReconnectServer(true)` - Run this if you ever get an analytic engine not available or if you made changes to your py file. Otherwise, you can ignore this step.
- `SetContext("Insert ID obtained from step 3")`
- `Compile("Insert ID obtained from step 3")`
  ![ConsoleCommandsSetProject](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/ConsoleCommandstoSetProjectContextandTestReactor.PNG)

6. Now, run your reactor. If the name of your Java file is "TestReactor.java", then to validate your reactor in the terminal, you can now run Test().

- Note: Any changes to any file need to be recompiled using the Compile command.

7. In your front-end code. Whenever your load your app, make sure to run these pixel calls before any other reactors:

- `ReconnectServer(true)` - Run this if you ever get an analytic engine not available or if you made changes to your py file. Otherwise, you can ignore this step.
- `SetContext("Insert ID obtained from step 3")`
- `Compile("Insert ID obtained from step 3")`
- Note: Remove those three commands when you deploy your app to CFG. These commands are setting the context to your temporary project. However, when you deploy an app it's context is set to itself so there is no need to use another source. Remember that any changes to your reactors or Py file need to be uploaded to the project through step 4.

## Calling a Reactor using Pixel

Now after creating a reactor the next step is to Test whether reactor is working as required. For that, open the SEMOSS server and and click on **Terminal** in App Library as shown below.

![Terminal](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/Terminal.PNG)

> _Terminal in App Library_

It will take you into the SEMOSS terminal where we can use pixel calls to run the reactor. Below you can see how the terminal looks.

![Semoss Terminal](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/Inside%20Terminal.PNG)

> _Semoss Terminal_

Enter the reactor you want to run and Add user inputs of that reactor within the bracket(). See the illustration below.

![Pixel Call](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/Enter%20pixel%20call.PNG)

> _Calling a Reactor using Pixel Call_

Now enter and run the reactor and if it does not return any error, reactor is successfully tested.

## Using a reactor in Front-end code

For using reactor in App code, install the SDK using a package manager:
`npm install @semoss/sdk`

Now, to import the `Insight` from the SDK and create a new instance of it, add below line in App code.

```
import {Insight} from '@semoss/sdk';
const insight = new Insight();
```

Insights are temporal workspaces that allow end users to script and interact with a model, storage engine, or database.

Once the application is mounted, initialize the insight and load your data App into the insight by putting below line in App code;

```
await insight.initialize();
```

After initialization, add below line to run the pixel call.

```
await insight.actions.pixel call
```

Pixel call could be **login-logout, askModel, queryDatabase,run, upload, download etc.**

With this line in the App code, pixel call will run the reactor in the App.

Examples are shown below:

### Query a LLM and return a result

```
const ask = (question) => {
    const { output } = await insight.actions.askModel(MODEL_ID, question);

    // log the output
    console.log(output);
};
```

### Run a database query

```
const getMovies = () => {
    const { output } = await insight.actions.queryDatabase(
        DATABASE_ID,
        'select * from movie',
    );

    // log the output
    console.log(output);
};
```

# CRUD Operations In A Custom Reactor

## Guide to Creating a Custom Reactor

The following guide demonstrates how to implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations within a custom reactor in SEMOSS. Leveraging SEMOSS’s flexible architecture, developers can seamlessly interact with databases, enforce data integrity, and extend application capabilities. This step-by-step tutorial offers clear instructions for integrating CRUD logic into your custom reactors, supporting the development of robust and maintainable data management solutions.

### SEMOSS Database CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) Operations Tutorial

SEMOSS enables rapid customization for performing CRUD operations on databases. In this tutorial, you will learn how to implement create, read, update, and delete actions using a Movie dataset as an example.

The database metamodel is illustrated below:

![Movie Metamodel](../../../static/img/Creating%20a%20custom%20reactor/movie-metamodel.PNG)
> _Database Construct_

**To follow along, reference the [Movie Management Project](../../../../static/assets/Backend%20Files/Project).**

*The project folder includes insights for performing CRUD operations and Java classes for each operation in the `assets/java` directory. For brevity, pixel input/output definitions are omitted here. For details on handling inputs, see the relevant documentation in other tutorials.*

#### SEMOSS Database Connection
To perform operations on a database in SEMOSS, you can retrieve the database by its ID. In this example, our database is an `RDBMSNativeEngine`. The `RDBMSNativeEngine` provides a method `getPreparedStatement(String query)` to obtain a `PreparedStatement`.

#### Creating a New Genre
To create a new genre, first define your SQL query for inserting into the table. Next, obtain your database connection and create a `PreparedStatement` from the query. Finally, add your arguments and execute the `PreparedStatement`.

```java
    private static String insertQuery = "INSERT INTO GENRE (GENRE, TITLE_FK) VALUES (?, ?)";
    
    RDBMSNativeEngine database = (RDBMSNativeEngine) Utility.getEngine(databaseId);
    PreparedStatement ps = null;
    try {
        int i = 1;
        ps = database.getPreparedStatement(AddGenreReactor.insertQuery);
        ps.setString(i++, genre);
        ps.setString(i++, title);
        ps.execute();
        database.commit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        logger.error(Constants.STACKTRACE, e);
        return NounMetadata.getErrorNounMessage("SQL ERROR: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        ConnectionUtils.closePreparedStatement(ps);
    }

```

**This reactor can be tested in the pixel console in SEMOSS by running:**
```
AddGenre(database=["2555ec1b-e1a2-4905-91e0-022dc57fc564"], title=["Semoss"], genre=["Tech Documentary"]);
```

#### Updating a Movie Title
In our Movie Database a Movie Title is the primary key. If we update a Movie Title in one table, we also need to do it in the others. First, we create our sql queries to perform the updates across multiple tables. Then, we get our database connection and create PreparedStatements from the queries. Finally, we add our arguments and execute the PreparedStatements.

```java
    private static final String titleUpdate = "UPDATE TITLE SET TITLE = ? WHERE TITLE = ?";
    private static final String nominatedUpdate = "UPDATE NOMINATED SET TITLE_FK = ? WHERE TITLE_FK = ?";
    private static final String genreUpdate = "UPDATE GENRE SET TITLE_FK = ? WHERE TITLE_FK = ?";
    
    RDBMSNativeEngine database = (RDBMSNativeEngine) Utility.getEngine(databaseId);
    database.setAutoCommit(false);
    PreparedStatement titlePS = null;
    PreparedStatement genrePS = null;
    PreparedStatement nomintationPS = null;
    try {
        // update title table
        titlePS = database.getPreparedStatement(UpdateMovieReactor.titleUpdate);
        titlePS.setString(1, newTitle);
        titlePS.setString(2, title);
        // update genre table
        genrePS = database.getPreparedStatement(UpdateMovieReactor.genreUpdate);
        genrePS.setString(1, newTitle);
        genrePS.setString(2, title);
        // update nomination table
        nomintationPS = database.getPreparedStatement(UpdateMovieReactor.nominatedUpdate);
        nomintationPS.setString(1, newTitle);
        nomintationPS.setString(2, title);
        titlePS.execute();
        genrePS.execute();
        nomintationPS.execute();
        database.commit();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        return NounMetadata.getErrorNounMessage("SQL ERROR: " + e.getMessage());
    }
    finally {
        ConnectionUtils.closePreparedStatement(titlePS);
        ConnectionUtils.closePreparedStatement(genrePS);
        ConnectionUtils.closePreparedStatement(nomintationPS);
    }

```

**This reactor can be tested in the pixel console in SEMOSS by running:**
```
UpdateMovie(database=["2555ec1b-e1a2-4905-91e0-022dc57fc564"], title=["Semoss"],  newTitle=["SEMOSS"]);
```

#### Deleting a Genre
To perform a deletion on the database, first we write our deletion query. Then, we get our database connection and generate a PreparedStatement. Finally, we add our arguments and execute the PreparedStatement.

```java
    private static String deleteQuery = "DELETE FROM GENRE WHERE GENRE = ?";
    // delete genre from the database
    RDBMSNativeEngine database = (RDBMSNativeEngine) Utility.getEngine(databaseId);
    PreparedStatement ps = null;
    try {
        int i = 1;
        ps = database.getPreparedStatement(DeleteGenreReactor.deleteQuery);
        ps.setString(i++, genre);
        ps.execute();
    } catch (SQLException e) {
        return NounMetadata.getErrorNounMessage("SQL ERROR: " + e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        ConnectionUtils.closePreparedStatement(ps);
    }
```
**This reactor can be tested in the pixel console in SEMOSS by running:**
```
DeleteGenre(database=["2555ec1b-e1a2-4905-91e0-022dc57fc564"], genre=["Tech Documentary"]);
```

## Case Statement Query Reactor
In this tutorial, we will create a query that dynamically generates a "Movie Recommendation" column for each movie entry, based on specific audience rating thresholds. By leveraging conditional logic within SQL-like queries, you will learn how to classify movies into categories such as "High," "Medium," or "Low" recommendation, providing actionable insights directly within your dataset. This approach demonstrates how to enrich your data with derived columns using case statements, enhancing the analytical capabilities of your custom reactors.

**Add the [Movies Database](../../../../static/assets/Backend%20Files/Database/Movies__2555ec1b-e1a2-4905-91e0-022dc57fc564) and [CaseStatementQueryReactor.java](../../../../static/assets/Backend%20Files/SRC/reactors/query/CaseStatementQueryReactor.java)**



#### QueryIfSelector
We will use the `QueryIfSelector.makeQueryIfSelector()` for simplicity, this method takes in the condition, prescedent, antecedent and alias. Our Movie Recommendation column will be based on RottenTomatoes_Audience

```
CASE
when RottenTomatoes_Audience >= .8 then High 
when RottenTomatoes_Audience >= .7 then Medium 
when RottenTomatoes_Audience >= .5 then Low 
ELSE ""
as "Movie Recommendation"
```

```
qs.addSelector(
    QueryIfSelector.makeQueryIfSelector(
        SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("Title__RottenTomatoes_Audience", ">=", 0.8),
        new QueryConstantSelector("High"),
    QueryIfSelector.makeQueryIfSelector(
        SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("Title__RottenTomatoes_Audience", ">=", .7),
        new QueryConstantSelector("Medium"),
    QueryIfSelector.makeQueryIfSelector(
        SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("Title__RottenTomatoes_Audience", ">=", .5),
        new QueryConstantSelector("Low"), 
        new QueryConstantSelector(""), // Else no recommendation
        "Movie Recommendation"),
        "Movie Recommendation"),
        "Movie Recommendation")
);
```

// File: Understanding Development\Java Development\Python Reactors

# Running Python Scripts from a Custom Reactor

## Overview
To run python within a custom reactor use a PyTranslator object. Every reactor has an insight associated with it that can be used to create a pyTranslator object:

```java
PyTranslator pyt = this.insight.getPyTranslator();
```

To execute a python script using the PythonTransator send a string holding a python script to the runScript function. 

```java
Object output = pyt.runScript(pythonScript);
```

This function will return the output from the script as an object. If you want the output to be returned as a string you can use the function below:

```java
String output = pyt.runPyAndReturnOutput(pythonScript);
```

To run to script without returning any output you can use:

```java
pyt.runEmptyPy(pythonScript);
```

## Example using the PyTranslator

This example executes a python script created inline that returns "Hello World!"

```java
// Get PyTranslator from insight in the custom reactor
PyTranslator pyt = this.insight.getPyTranslator();

// Creating a string representing a python script
StringBuilder callMaker = new StringBuilder("var1 = Hello\n");	
callMaker.append("var2 = World!\n");
callMaker.append("var1 + var2");

// Execute python script from string
Object output = pyt.runScript(callMaker.toString());

return output;
```

# Running Python Scripts from a File in a Reactor

Custom reactors allow you to run a python file directly from the java code. To use a custom python class utilize the LoadPyFromFileReactor. The LoadPyFromFileReactor takes in three parameters filePath (the path to the python file), space (project id), and alias (the name used to refer to the class once loaded).

## Example of using LoadPyFromFileReactor to load a python class

```java
// Get the current project id
String projectId = this.insight.getProjectId();
if (projectId == null) projectId = this.insight.getContextProjectId();

// Create a noun store and set the parameters required for the LoadPyFromFileReactor
NounStore ns = new NounStore(ReactorKeysEnum.ALL.getKey());
ns.makeNoun("filePath").addLiteral("version/assets/py/python_class.py");
ns.makeNoun(ReactorKeysEnum.SPACE.getKey()).addLiteral(projectId);
ns.makeNoun("alias").addLiteral("class_alias");

// Create and initialize new reactor object
LoadPyFromFileReactor loadPy = new LoadPyFromFileReactor();
loadPy.setPixelPlanner(this.getPixelPlanner());
loadPy.setInsight(this.insight);
loadPy.setNounStore(ns);
loadPy.In();

// Execute reactor
NounMetadata loadPyResponse = loadPy.execute();
if (loadPyResponse.getNounType().equals(PixelDataType.ERROR)) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("ERROR: " + loadPyResponse.getExplanation());
}
```

Once the python class is loaded you can call it via the PyReactor or a PyTranslator as show above.

## Example of running python script from a file

We have the following python script we want to run within a custom reactor:

```python
from datetime import datetime

def custom_python_function():
    dateTime = datetime.now()
    return str(dateTime)

print("Current Date and Time: " + custom_python_function())
```

To execute this script we read from the file into a string and then send that to the PyTranslator from the insight:

```java
String filePath = "path/to/example.py";

try {
    String pyScript = new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath)));
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}

PyTranslator pyt = this.insight.getPyTranslator();
Object output = pyt.runScript(pyScript);

return output;
```

The PyTranslator runScript function returns the output of the python script as an Object.

# Creating a Custom Model Reactor

## Overview

A reactor in SEMOSS is a modular unit of business logic designed to perform specific operations in response to user requests. Reactors encapsulate the core functionality needed to process input data, apply custom logic, and produce meaningful results for end users. In the context of this guide, you'll learn how to create a custom reactor that interacts with a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate jokes based on user input. This approach demonstrates how reactors can be extended to integrate advanced AI capabilities, enabling dynamic and engaging user experiences within SEMOSS.

## Custom Model Reactor Guide 

In this guide, you'll learn how to create a custom model reactor in SEMOSS that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate jokes based on user input. We'll walk through the process of building a `GenerateJoke` reactor, which takes user-provided text, constructs a prompt, and uses an LLM to produce a relevant joke.

Before proceeding, it is recommended that you are familiar with the basics of creating and running a custom reactor. For reference, please review the [Creating and Running a Custom Reactor guide](Custom%20Reactors.md).

This tutorial assumes you have a basic understanding of SEMOSS reactors and Java development. By the end, you'll know how to:

- Define a custom reactor class.
- Integrate an LLM model into your reactor.
- Accept user input and generate dynamic prompts.
- Return the generated joke as output.

Let's get started by setting up the custom reactor structure.

## Defining and Implementing a Custom Model Reactor

When working with LLMs or advanced model integrations, it is common to extend the `AskReactor` class, which provides additional features for handling prompts and model queries. The `AskReactor` constructor typically defines two main keys: `command` (the user’s question or instruction) and `fullPrompt` (an optional, fully-formed prompt for the model):

```java
private static final String FULL_PROMPT = "fullPrompt";

public AskReactor() {
    this.keysToGet = new String[] {ReactorKeysEnum.COMMAND.getKey(), FULL_PROMPT};
    this.keyRequired = new int[] {0, 0};
}
```

In the `execute()` method, you can access not only the direct user inputs, but also a rich set of model query parameters by retrieving a `ModelInferenceQueryStruct` object. This struct provides:
- **context:** Additional context or background information for the model.
- **hyperParameters:** A map of model-specific tuning parameters (e.g., temperature, max tokens).
- **engineId:** The identifier for the model engine to use.

Here’s how you might use these features in your reactor:

```java
@Override
public NounMetadata execute() {
    this.organizeKeys();
    ModelInferenceQueryStruct qs = getQueryStruct();

    IModelEngine model = Utility.getModel(qs.getEngineId());

    String question = this.keyValue.get(ReactorKeysEnum.COMMAND.getKey());
    String context = qs.getContext();
    Map<String, Object> hyperParameters = qs.getHyperParameters();
    Object fullPrompt = getFullPrompt();

    // Use question, context, hyperParameters, and fullPrompt as needed
    // Call the model and return the result as NounMetadata
    return ...;
}
```

The `getQueryStruct()` method ensures that your reactor can access the full query context, whether it is provided in the current row or in the general store. If a valid query struct is not found, it throws an error to prompt the user to supply the necessary information.

By leveraging these features, your custom reactor can support flexible user inputs, advanced prompt engineering, and fine-tuned model interactions, making it easy to build powerful AI-driven workflows in SEMOSS.

---

## AskReactor

A typical pattern for LLM integration is to extend the `AskReactor`, which handles prompt construction and model querying. Here’s a minimal version of the code:

```java
public class AskReactor extends AbstractReactor {
    private static final String FULL_PROMPT = "fullPrompt";

    public AskReactor() {
        this.keysToGet = new String[] {ReactorKeysEnum.COMMAND.getKey(), FULL_PROMPT};
        this.keyRequired = new int[] {0, 0};
    }

    @Override
    public NounMetadata execute() {
        this.organizeKeys();
        ModelInferenceQueryStruct qs = getQueryStruct();

        IModelEngine model = Utility.getModel(qs.getEngineId());

        String question = this.keyValue.get(ReactorKeysEnum.COMMAND.getKey());
        String context = qs.getContext();
        Map<String, Object> hyperParameters = qs.getHyperParameters();
        Object fullPrompt = getFullPrompt();

        if (question == null && fullPrompt == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Please provide either an input using either command or fullPrompt.");
        }

        if (fullPrompt != null) {
            if (hyperParameters == null) {
                hyperParameters = new HashMap<>();
            }
            hyperParameters.put(AbstractModelEngine.FULL_PROMPT, fullPrompt);
        } else {
            question = Utility.decodeURIComponent(question);
        }

        Map<String, Object> output = model.ask(question, context, this.insight, hyperParameters).toMap();
        return new NounMetadata(output, PixelDataType.MAP, PixelOperationType.OPERATION);
    }

    // getFullPrompt() and getQueryStruct() methods omitted for brevity
}
```

---

## Minimal Example: GenerateJokeReactor

To implement a joke generator, extend `AskReactor` and customize the prompt logic:

```java
public class GenerateJokeReactor extends AskReactor {
    @Override
    public NounMetadata execute() {
        this.organizeKeys();
        String topic = this.keyValue.get(ReactorKeysEnum.COMMAND.getKey());
        if (topic == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Please provide a topic using 'command'.");
        }
        String prompt = "Tell me a joke about " + topic + ".";
        this.keyValue.put("fullPrompt", prompt);
        return super.execute();
    }
}
```

**Summary:**  
- Extend `AskReactor` for LLM-based reactors.
- Use `command` or `fullPrompt` as input.
- For custom logic (like joke generation), build the prompt and delegate to the base reactor.

For more details, see the [SEMOSS documentation](Pixels.md).

## Overview Of SQS

The `SelectQueryStruct` (SQS) is a custom object used within the SEMOSS framework to facilitate querying various sources. It simplifies the process of crafting SQL, R, Python queries by providing a structured approach to define query components such as selectors, filters, sorts, joins, and groupings.

## Example
```java
/** An example that utilizes many different features that the SQS offers **/

SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct();

// Selectors: Specify columns to retrieve
qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("EmployeeTable__EmployeeName"));
qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("EmployeeTable__EmployeeAge"));
qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("DepartmentTable__DepartmentName"));

// Relations: Implement a left outer join between EmployeeTable and DepartmentTable
qs.addRelation("EmployeeTable__DepartmentID", 
               "DepartmentTable__DepartmentID", "left.outer.join");

// Filters: Combine conditions using AND and OR filters
AndQueryFilter andFilters = new AndQueryFilter();
andFilters.addFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("EmployeeTable__EmployeeAge", ">", "30"));
andFilters.addFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("DepartmentTable__DepartmentName", "==", "Engineering"));

OrQueryFilter orFilters = new OrQueryFilter();
orFilters.addFilter(andFilters);
orFilters.addFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("EmployeeTable__EmployeeName", "=", "John Doe"));

qs.addExplicitFilter(orFilters);

// Math Function: Calculate the average age of employees in each department
QueryFunctionSelector averageAgeFunction = new QueryFunctionSelector();
averageAgeFunction.setFunction(QueryFunctionHelper.AVERAGE_2);
averageAgeFunction.addInnerSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("EmployeeTable__EmployeeAge"));
averageAgeFunction.setAlias("Average_Employee_Age");
qs.addSelector(averageAgeFunction);

// Ordering: Sort results by EmployeeName and DepartmentName
qs.addOrderBy("EmployeeTable__EmployeeName");
qs.addOrderBy("DepartmentTable__DepartmentName");

// Grouping: Group results by DepartmentName
qs.addGroupBy(new QueryColumnSelector("DepartmentTable__DepartmentName"));

// Iterate through the results of the SQS
Iterator<?> iterator = WrapperManager.getInstance().getRawWrapper(database, qs);
while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    // Process each result
}
```
Here is the resultinig SQL Select Statement that is generated:
```sql
SELECT EmployeeTable.EmployeeName, DepartmentTable.DepartmentName, AVG(EmployeeTable.EmployeeAge) AS "AverageAge" 
FROM EmployeeTable LEFT JOIN DepartmentTable ON EmployeeTable.DepartmentID = DepartmentTable.DepartmentID 
WHERE (EmployeeTable.EmployeeAge > 30 
AND DepartmentTable.DepartmentName = 'Engineering') 
OR (Director.Director = 'M._Night_Shyamalan') 
GROUP BY DepartmentTable.DepartmentName, EmployeeTable.EmployeeName 
ORDER BY EmployeeTable.EmployeeName, DepartmentTable__DepartmentName;
```
This example demonstrates how to use the `SelectQueryStruct` to:

-   **Select specific columns**: Retrieve employee *names*, *ages*, and *department names* from the `EmployeeTable` and `DepartmentTable`.
-   **Join tables**: Perform a left outer join between `EmployeeTable` and `DepartmentTable` using `DepartmentID`.
-   **Filter results**: Include employees older than 30 in the Engineering department or named John Doe.
-   **Calculate average**: Compute the average age of employees within each department.
-   **Order results**: Sort the output by employee name and department name.
-   **Group results**: Group the data by department name to aggregate the average age calculation.

## Selectors


Selectors in the `SelectQueryStruct` (SQS) are used to define which columns should be included in the query. They specify the data that will be retrieved from the data source. *QueryColumnSelector* are CASE Sensitive -- Make sure to check the case for the actual table and column to get results.


Here is an example of how selectors are used within an SQS:   

```java  
SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct();
    
// Adding selectors to specify columns to be retrieved
qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("USERS" + "__" + "NAME"));
qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("USERS" + "__" + "AGE"));
qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("USERS" + "__" + MyConstants.CITY));
```
#### Adding an alias
```java
QueryColumnSelector columnSelector = new QueryColumnSelector("EmployeeTable__EmployeeName"); 
// Set an alias for the column 
columnSelector.setAlias("Employee_Name");
qs.addSelector(columnSelector);
```

-   **`QueryColumnSelector`**: This object represents a column in the database. It takes in the Table and Column Name that you want to retrieve. In this example, *"USERS"* is the Table Name and the Column Name is a value or a const reference.
-   **`addSelector` Method**: This method is used to add a column to the SELECT query. Each call to `addSelector` specifies a new column to be included.
- **`Setting an Alias`**: The `setAlias` method is used to assign a temporary name to the column in the query results. In the example, `columnSelector.setAlias("Employee_Name")` assigns the alias `"Employee_Name"` to the `EmployeeTable__EmployeeName` column.


## Filters

Filters in the `SelectQueryStruct` (SQS) are used to define conditions that must be met for rows to be included in the SELECT query.

Here is an example of how filters are used within an SQS:

```Java
SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct();

// Adding filters to specify conditions for the query
qs.addExplicitFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("USERS" + "__" + "NAME", "==", "Peter Parker"));
qs.addExplicitFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("USERS" + "__" + VHASuppConst.CITY, "==", "New York City"));` 
```
-   **`SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter`**: This method creates a filter condition where a column is compared to a specific value. In the example, it specifies that the `NAME` column must be equal to "Peter Parker" and the `CITY` column must be equal to "New York City".
-   **`addExplicitFilter` Method**: This method is used to add a filter condition to the SELECT statement. Each call to `addExplicitFilter` specifies a new condition that must be met for rows to be included in the query results.

### AND Filter

The `AndQueryFilter` allows you to combine multiple conditions using the `AND` keyword, ensuring that all specified criteria are met.

**Example:**

```Java

AndQueryFilter andFilters = new AndQueryFilter();
andFilters.addFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("MovieTable__RottenTomatoes_Audience", ">", 0.8));
andFilters.addFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("MovieTable__RottenTomatoes_Critics", ">", 0.8));` 
```
-   **Purpose**: Filters movies with audience and critic ratings greater than 0.8.

### OR Filter

The `OrQueryFilter` allows you to combine conditions using the `OR` keyword, ensuring that at least one of the specified criteria is met.

**Example:**

```Java

OrQueryFilter orFilters = new OrQueryFilter();
orFilters.addFilter(andFilters);
orFilters.addFilter(SimpleQueryFilter.makeColToValFilter("DirectorTable__DirectorName", "=", "M._Night_Shyamalan"));` 
```
-   **Purpose**: Filters movies directed by M. Night Shyamalan or those with high audience and critic ratings.

### Applying And/Or Filters

To use these filters in your query, add them to the `SelectQueryStruct` using `addExplicitFilter`.

**Example:**

Java

`SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct();
qs.addExplicitFilter(orFilters);` 

-   **Resulting SQL Statement**:
    
    SQL
    
    `SELECT MovieTitle, DirectorName, RottenTomatoes_Audience, RottenTomatoes_Critics 
    FROM MovieTable 
    LEFT JOIN DirectorTable ON MovieTable.MovieID = DirectorTable.MovieID_FK 
    WHERE DirectorName = 'M._Night_Shyamalan' OR (RottenTomatoes_Audience > 0.8 AND RottenTomatoes_Critics > 0.8);` 
    
-   **Purpose**: Retrieves movies either highly rated by audiences and critics or directed by M. Night Shyamalan.


## Relations (Joins)

Relations in the `SelectQueryStruct` (SQS) are used to implement joins, allowing you to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns. This feature is essential for retrieving comprehensive datasets that span across different tables.

Here is an example of how relations (joins) are used within an SQS:

```Java
SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct();

// Adding a relation to perform a left outer join between two tables
qs.addRelation("REQUEST_TABLE" + "__" + "ITEM_TYPE", "CATALOG_TABLE" + "__" + "ITEM_TYPE", "left.outer.join");` 
```
-   **`addRelation` Method**: This method is used to define a join between two tables. It specifies the columns to join on and the type of join (e.g., "left.outer.join").

## Ordering

Ordering in the `SelectQueryStruct` (SQS) is used to specify the order in which the query results should be returned. Useful for sorting data.

Here is an example of how ordering is used within an SQS:

```Java
SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct();

// Adding order by clauses to sort the query results
qs.addOrderBy("REQUEST_TABLE" + "__" + "DATE_CREATED");
qs.addOrderBy("REQUEST_TABLE" + "__" + "REQUEST_ITEM_ID");` 
```
-   **`addOrderBy` Method**: This method is used to add columns to the ORDER BY clause of the query. Each call specifies a new column to sort by.

## Grouping

Grouping in the `SelectQueryStruct` (SQS) is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used in conjunction with aggregate functions.

Here is an example of how grouping is used within an SQS:

```Java
SelectQueryStruct qs2 = new SelectQueryStruct();

// Adding group by clauses to group the query results
qs2.addGroupBy(new QueryColumnSelector("REQUEST_ITEM_ID"));
qs2.addGroupBy(new QueryColumnSelector("PICK_TICKET_STATUS"));` 
```
-   **`addGroupBy` Method**: This method is used to add columns to the GROUP BY clause of the query. Each call specifies a new column to group by.
-   **`QueryColumnSelector`**: Represents the column to be used for grouping.

## Limit/Offset

To limit the amount of data being returned you can add a limit and offset

```java
qs.setLimit(100);

qs.setOffSet(20);
```

## Math Functions
This tutorial demonstrates how to incorporate mathematical functions such as `SUM`, `COUNT`, and `AVG` into `SelectQueryStructs` using the Movies Database and `MathFunctionsReactor.java`.

### Adding Math Functions (AVG, SUM, and COUNT)
```Java
SelectQueryStruct qs = new SelectQueryStruct(); 

qs.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("Director__Director"));

// Add AVG function to SQS
QueryFunctionSelector averageFunction = new QueryFunctionSelector();
averageFunction.setFunction(QueryFunctionHelper.AVERAGE_2);
averageFunction.addInnerSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("Title__RottenTomatoes_Critics"));
averageFunction.setAlias("Average_Critic_Rating");
// Add the math function to the SQS as a selector
qs.addSelector(averageFunction);

// Add SUM function to SQS
QueryFunctionSelector sumFunction = new QueryFunctionSelector();
sumFunction.setFunction(QueryFunctionHelper.SUM);
sumFunction.addInnerSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("Title__Revenue_Domestic"));
sumFunction.setAlias("Total_Domestic_Revenue");
// Add the math function to the SQS as a selector
qs.addSelector(sumFunction);

// Add COUNT function to SQS
QueryFunctionSelector countFunction = new QueryFunctionSelector();
countFunction.setFunction(QueryFunctionHelper.COUNT);
countFunction.addInnerSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("Title__Title"));
countFunction.setAlias("Total_Movies_Directed");
// Add the math function to the SQS as a selector
qs.addSelector(countFunction);
```
### Resulting SQL Statement

The constructed query will be:

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT 
    Director.Director AS "Director", 
    AVG(Title.RottenTomatoes_Critics) AS "Average_Critic_Rating", 
    SUM(Title.Revenue_Domestic) AS "Total_Domestic_Revenue", 
    COUNT(Title.Title) AS "Total_Movies_Directed" 
FROM Title 
LEFT JOIN Director ON Title.Title = Director.Title_FK 
GROUP BY Director.Director;
```
This query retrieves each director's name, the average critic rating of their films, the total domestic revenue, and the total number of films directed. For more details on table joins, refer to the relations tutorial.


## Subquery
This section demonstrates the basics of creating and adding a subquery to the Select Query Struct. Oftentimes these subqueries are broken off into a separate method that returns a SelectQueryStruct object that can be joined to the main SQS  via the `addRelation(new SubqueryRelationship)` method.

### Simple Example

```Java
// Main query setup
SelectQueryStruct mainQuery = new SelectQueryStruct();
mainQuery.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("Catalog__CanRequest"));
mainQuery.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("Catalog__CanShip"));

// Subquery setup
SelectQueryStruct subQuery = new SelectQueryStruct();
subQuery.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("PickTicket__RequestItemID"));
subQuery.addSelector(new QueryColumnSelector("PickTicket__Status"));

// Link subquery to main query
List<String[]> joinDetails = new ArrayList<>();
joinDetails.add(new String[] {"Request__RequestItemID", "PickTicket__RequestItemID", "="});
mainQuery.addRelation(new SubqueryRelationship(subQuery, "PickTicket", "left.join", joinDetails));` 
```

-   **Main Query**: The primary query that retrieves data from the main tables.
-   **SubQuery**: A secondary query that retrieves related data, which can be used to enhance or filter the main query's results.
-   **Linking**: The subquery is linked to the main query using `SubqueryRelationship`, specifying how the subquery results should be joined with the main query.

# How To Write Unit Tests in SEMOSS


Unit testing helps ensure code is reliable, maintainable, and functions as expected in isolation. In SEMOSS, we use **JUnit** for testing and **Mockito** for mocking, while following a consistent folder structure to keep tests organized and discoverable.

This guide will walk through:

- SEMOSS's expected test directory structure
- How to write unit tests using JUnit
- How to mock dependencies with Mockito
- Where to find good examples in the existing codebase

---

## Test Directory Structure

SEMOSS follows a mirrored structure between main and test sources. This helps maintain clarity and consistency when navigating between classes and their test cases.

```plaintext
semoss/
├── src/
│   ├── prerna/
│   │   └── examplepackage/
│   │         └── YourClass.java
├── test/
    ├── prerna/
│       └──examplePackage/
│            └── YourClassTest.java

```

Each class in src should have a corresponding test class in test, under the same package path.

⸻

**Writing Unit Tests with JUnit**

JUnit is used for defining and running test cases. SEMOSS projects generally use JUnit 5.

The documentation can be found here https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/

Here’s a basic example of a test using @Test and assertEquals:

```plaintext

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class YourClassTest {

    @Test
    public void testMethod() {
        YourClass instance = new YourClass();
        int result = instance.methodUnderTest();
        assertEquals(expectedValue, result);
    }
}

	•	@Test: Marks a method as a test case
	•	assertEquals: Compares expected and actual values

```

You can also create a test suite that runs all tests in the specified package using the @Suite and @SelectPackages annotations.

Here's an example:

```
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.SelectPackages;
import org.junit.platform.suite.api.Suite;

@Suite
@SelectPackages("prerna.examplePackage")
public class YourTestSuite {
    // This class can be empty
}
```

To run a test class/suite, in Eclipse you can right click on the source file and select `Run as > 2 Junit Test` (Or you can hit `Ctrl-Alt-X T` (Windows), `Cmd-Opt-X T` (Mac) while selecting the source file)

⸻

**Mocking Dependencies with Mockito**

Mockito helps isolate behavior by mocking external dependencies.

The documentation can be found here https://javadoc.io/doc/org.mockito/mockito-core/latest/org.mockito/module-summary.html

Here’s a common Mockito pattern:

```plaintext

import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class YourClassTest {

    private DependencyClass mockDependency;
    private YourClass instance;

    @BeforeEach
    public void setUp() {
        mockDependency = mock(DependencyClass.class);
        instance = new YourClass(mockDependency);
    }

    @Test
    public void testWithMock() {
        when(mockDependency.someMethod()).thenReturn(expectedValue);
        int result = instance.methodUnderTest();
        assertEquals(expectedValue, result);
        verify(mockDependency).someMethod();
    }
}

	•	mock(): Creates a mock of a dependency
	•	when(...).thenReturn(...): Defines return behavior
	•	verify(...): Confirms that expected calls were made

```

⸻

**Existing Test Examples**

SEMOSS already includes a rich set of unit tests. If you’re unsure how to test something, look around:
	1.	Go to the test package
	2.	Find the package matching your module, or a related one
	3.	Open an existing *Test.java file



⸻

**Next Steps** \
	•   Start by writing a small test for any new method you write. \
	•	Review existing test files when you’re stuck. \
	•	Reach out to your team or the CFG AI support group at [CFGAI@deloitte.com](mailto:CFGAI@deloitte.com) if you’re not sure how to test a specific component.

// File: Understanding Development\Javascript Development\Guide for Building a JavaScript App (Node.js)

# Creating a SEMOSS GenAI App Using React

## Overview
This documentation focuses on the front end aspects of building a GenAI app. React is a Javascript-based User Interface (UI) framework. It improves reusability of UI elements to keep code readable and DRY ("Don't Repeat Yourself"). You can leverage React to develop a hosted front end with the potential to have some custom backend functionality that is deployed on the SEMOSS Server.

The languages used in this app will be Typescript/Javascript, and HTML in building your app. Typescript is an extension of Javascript that improves code quality and allows for a better developer experience.

## Prerequisites
### Node.js
You can install Node on your machine by downloading the appropriate installer for your device directly from the Node.js website. Version [v18.16.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v18.16.0/) is suggested for our projects (for most Windows machines, you should download `node-v18.16.0-x64.msi`). 

### Code Editor
You'll need to have your code editor of choice downloaded on your machine. We suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
<!--Should we mention something about installing VSCode extensions for typescript/javascript?-->

## Examples
You can see app examples in the [SEMOSS Apps](https://github.com/Deloitte-Default/cfgai-apps) repo. Feel free to download an existing app and use it as scaffold for building your own! Existing work can be used to experiment and learn.
> **Note**
> This is a protected GitHub, if you do not have access to it, or are not currently signed in to your GitHub account you will get a 404 Error. Ask an admin for access.
<!--Should we link to the public CFG demo here so that first time users can click around and explore the apps in the live site? For a user encountering this guide for the first time, they probably won't know how to interact with the apps in the CFGai-apps repo. It might be useful to copy the "Adding your app to the SEMOSS catalog" section of this guide over to the CFGai-apps repo's README.md so that users can be guided on what to do after they've pulled the repo (ex. zipping the files and adding the app within CFG)-->
<!--Since this is a React app use case, do all the examples in the CFGai-apps repo also use React? I'm not sure how important this is but it might be helpful for users following this guide to base their app off of another React app in the CFGai-apps repo-->

## App Structure
Below is the typical structure of a React app to be uploaded onto the SEMOSS platform. The `/java` and `/py` directories hold back-end work. This document will focus on the `client` and `portals` folders.

### `/client`

#### `/client/.env` / `/client/.env.local`
See the Environment Variables section of [Connecting to the CFG App](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md)

#### `/client/package.json`
NPM/PNPM stands for Node Package Manager and is included with Node. (PNPM is a newer, faster version of NPM but both can be used interchangably. If you find you don't have the `pnpm` command, you can install it with the following command: `npm install -g pnpm`.) 

NPM is how you can install [Node packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) that will help you on your app building journey. If you are using an existing project as a scaffold, you can run `pnpm install` **from the `client` directory** to download and install all the packages that are already in your package.json file. Otherwise, manually install required and suggested packages.

Below is a guide to required and suggested packages, but there are thousands out there that you can explore and use. Just make sure you choose ones that are reputable and actively managed!

##### Required Packages

| Package    | Installation Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)  | `pnpm i react` |
| [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) | `pnpm i react-dom` |
| [webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack)    | `pnpm i webpack` |
| [webpack-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-cli) | `pnpm i webpack` |
| [html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin) | `pnpm i html-webpack-plugin` |
| [webpack-dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-dev-server) | `pnpm i webpack-dev-server` |
| [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) | `pnpm i --save-dev dotenv` |
| [SEMOSS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@semoss/sdk-react) | `pnpm install @semoss/sdk-react/npm install @semoss/sdk` |

##### Helpful Packages

| Package    | Installation Command |
| -------- | ------- |
| [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)  | `pnpm i @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled` |
| [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) | `pnpm i react-router-dom` |

#### `/client/tsconfig.json`
This is a configuration file that indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. It specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project. Read more on it [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

#### `/client/webpack.config.js`
This is a configuration file that tells Webpack how to bundle your Javascript files so they can be displayed in a browser. Read more on it [here](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/).

#### `/client/src`
The `src` directory holds all the source files that make up the front end of your app.

##### `/client/src/assets`
This directory stores all your web assets, like logos, photos, and graphics.

##### `/client/src/components`
React is a component-driven framework. You can read more about component-driven UI development [here](https://www.componentdriven.org/#why). You can think of components like elements of a larger picture or pieces of a puzzle. This directory will contain all the components you develop to be used in your app pages, and you can organize them into sub-directories as you see fit.

Note that in order to use the hooks provided by the SEMOSS SDK, the component must be a functional component. Here's a helpful [article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-functional-components-and-class-components/) on the difference between functional and class components in React.

##### `/client/src/pages`
This directory contains full app pages, which likely leverage the custom components that you've created.

##### `/client/src/utilities`
This directory contains any non-component shared code you might need for your app. For example, you might have a `HelpText.tsx` file to keep all the help text for your app in one place. You might have a `NumberUtilties.tsx` file that has functions to standardize number formatting across your app.

##### `/client/src/App.tsx`
This files serves as the main component that will hold all your app contents/pages. For SEMOSS apps, the component returned in this file will need to wrap its content with `<UseInsights></UseInsights>` in order to utilize the SEMOSS SDK. Read more about it on [Front End Installation](../../Advanced%20Installation/Frontend%20Installation.md).
<!--As a front end newbie, I think it would be helpful to have a diagram that illustrates the relationship between the Semoss SDK, the App.tsx component, the pages that are in App.tsx, and the (smaller) components that are used on the pages-->

##### `/client/src/global.d.ts`
This file allows you declare global modules for import. For example, you might want to set up a module to import all .png files from your `/client/src/assets` folder so you can use the image somewhere in your app. (See an example of that [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51100401/typescript-image-import))

##### `/client/src/main.tsx`
This file connects your App to the HTML template by looking for the root element in your template. This file is typically structured like so:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import { App } from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <App />
    </React.StrictMode>,
    document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

##### `/client/src/template.html`
This file serves as the entrypoint for HtmlWebpackPlugin to build the HTML files for your project. `template` is the standard name, but you can customize it and specify it in your plugin configuration in `webpack.config.js`. See the Html WebpackPlugin Usage [documentation](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin#usage) for details.

The `template.html` will contain an HTML element with an id of `root` that `main.tsx` will hook onto, for example:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <title><%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %></title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    </head>

    <body>
        <div id="root"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```

### portals
This is the destination folder that should be configured as the [output](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/output/) in `webpack.config.js`. For example:
```
const config = {
    ...,
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, '../portals'),
        filename: '[name].[contenthash].js',
        clean: true,
    },
    ...
```
All you have to do is have the folder. Running Webpack will do the rest! (More on that in the [Bundling Your App](#bundling-your-app) section.)

## Connecting to a SEMOSS Instance

See [Connecting to CFG](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Connecting%20to%20CFG%20AI.md) for documentation on how to set up your app with API keys to be added as environment variables.

## Using the SEMOSS SDK

Learn more about how to use the SEMOSS SDK in the [Using the SDK](../Establish%20Connection%20to%20CFG%20Portal/Using%20the%20SDK.md) guide.

## Local Development with Webpack

Ensure that you have the following script in your `client/package.json` file:
```
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "dev": "webpack serve",
    ...
  }
```

From the `client` directory, run the command `npm run dev` in your terminal. This will start the Webpack server for your local project. Here's an example of what it looks like when the script is executed:
```
PS C:\Development\cfgai-apps\llm-tuner\client> npm run dev

> dev
> webpack serve

<i> [webpack-dev-server] [HPM] Proxy created: /Monolith  -> https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Project is running at:
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:3000/, http://127.0.0.1:3000/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] Content not from webpack is served from 'C:\Development\cfgai-apps\llm-tuner\client\public' directory
<i> [webpack-dev-server] 404s will fallback to '/index.html'
asset main.5c6e6707538d8566f277.js 3.43 MiB [emitted] [immutable] [big] (name: main)        
asset logo.svg 1.27 KiB [emitted]
asset index.html 371 bytes [emitted]
orphan modules 1.82 MiB [orphan] 961 modules
runtime modules 30.4 KiB 15 modules
cacheable modules 2.5 MiB 423 modules
webpack 5.88.2 compiled successfully in 14852 ms
```

In this output, you can confirm that the proxy created matches the module and endpoint set up in your .env.local. If you navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser, you'll be able to see your app. So long as this task is running in your terminal, Webpack will watch for changes so they will appear in the browser when the changed file is saved (occasionally, this make take a while or you'll have to refresh the browser page). 

## Bundling Your App

Ensure that you have the following script in your `client/package.json` file:
```
"scripts": {
    ...,
    "build": "webpack --mode=production --node-env=production",
    ...
  }
```

From the `client` directory, run the command `npm run build` in your terminal. Webpack will bundle your app and the bundled files will automatically be added to your `/portals` directory. If you don't see any files populate that folder, then you likely have an issue with your Webpack configuration.

## Adding Your App to the SEMOSS App Catalog

1. Compress all the directories in your project _except_ your `/client` folder. Ensure that you do this within the app directory. For example, if my app files are in a folder called `/MyApp`, I should not zip `/MyApp` itself. I should navigate into `/MyApp` and zip all the relevant directories inside of it. 
2. Navigate to [App Library](https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-demo/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/) and click "Create a New App" in the top right corner. This will bring you to the Create New App page.
![Create New App](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/app_building_options.png)
3. Click to "Get Started" under the Code option. Give your app a name and hit "Create." This will bring you to the Code Editor.
4. Click the Upload App Assets button at the top of the code file tree.
![Upload App Assets Button](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/code_editor_asset_upload.png)
5. Attach your zip file in the modal that appears and hit "Upload."
![Upload App Assets Modal](../../../static/img/AppUseCaseImages/asset_upload_dialog.png)
6. Ta-da! You have successfully uploaded your code app to the SEMOSS Server!

## Updating your App In CFG

Once you have finished making any updates to your app, these are the steps that you should follow to update your app in CFG. 

1. Use the previous section to bundle your app correctly. 
2. Compress all the directories in your project _except_ your `/client` folder. Ensure that you do this within the app directory. For example, if my app files are in a folder called `/MyApp`, I should not zip `/MyApp` itself. I should navigate into `/MyApp` and zip all the relevant directories inside of it. 
3. Navigate to your App in the App Library. Click the Edit App Icon in the top right. 
![Edit App](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/demoAPP_edit.PNG)
4. Once in the Edit App tab, navigate to the Settings Tab. 
![Settings Tab](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_settings.PNG)
5. Once in the settings section, you want to go to the Data Apps Section. 
![Data Apps](../../../static/img/UpdateApp/DemoApp_data.PNG)
6. Once you are in Data Apps, you want to take the zip that you created in Step Two and upload it in the dropdown and press update! Once this is done your app will be fully updated.

# Guide for Building a Python Function
To create a python function and expose in SEMOSS

1. Create a new directory in this example we will call it function-workspace
```
mkdir function-workspace
```
2. Go to function-workspace directory to create the new files
```
cd function-workspace
```
3. Create the function engine folder

Engine folders in SEMOSS are named as "ENGINENAME___ENGINEID"
```
mkdir myPyFunction__12345xb3-1234-5fe8-a3d5-888a23da489d
```
4. Create SMSS file and save as myPyFunction__12345xb3-1234-5fe8-a3d5-888a23da489d.smss
```
#Base Properties
ENGINE	12345xb3-1234-5fe8-a3d5-888a23da489d
ENGINE_ALIAS	myPyFunction
ENGINE_TYPE	prerna.engine.impl.function.LocalPythonFunctionEngine

FUNCTION_NAME generate_prompt
FUNCTION_DESCRIPTION This is a test python function.

FUNCTION_REQUIRED_PARAMETERS ["userName"]
FUNCTION_PARAMETERS [{"parameterName": "userName", "parameterType": "String", "parameterDescription": "user name"}]

PYTHON_FILE_NAME hello.py

```
5. Create python file

This is your custom file it must be located at the root directory of the engine folder. Note that the python file you create must be the same file name used in the SMSS. Your python file must also have the function name you specified in the SMSS.
```
cd myPyFunction__12345xb3-1234-5fe8-a3d5-888a23da489d
echo. > hello.py
```

For this example you can copy this simple python function into hello.py
```
def generate_prompt(userName: str):
    prompt = f"Hello: {userName}"
    return prompt
```

6. Zip up your function-workspace folder containing the engine folder and engine SMSS
![Function Engine Zip](../../../static/img/FunctionEngines/zip_custom_py_function_engine.png)
7. Upload to SEMOSS! [Add Zip File](../../documentation/platform-navigation/function-catalog#adding-a-zipped-function-engine)
8. Once uploaded you should be able to see it in the UI
9. To test the function, look at the usage tab. Modify according to your function. 

For this example we can run the following pixel in the terminal
```
ExecuteFunctionEngine(engine = "12345xb3-1234-5fe8-a3d5-888a23da489d", map=[{'userName':'Test'}] );
```
10. Success!!!!
