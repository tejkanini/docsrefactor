## Purpose

Learn how to send a prompt to an AI model and receive a response using the Model in AI Core. This recipe demonstrates a basic pro-code workflow for integrating a model into an application.

---

## How to Use

1. Go to the [model catalog](../Getting%20Started/Platform%20Navigation/Model%20Catalog.mdx), select a model that is most suitable for the usecase. 
![Models available](/img/SimpleModelInteraction/ModelCatalog.png)
There are many models available on the platform, and interacting with any of them follows the same process—the only difference is the unique model ID. 

2. Click on a specific model, in this example we will use the **GPT-4o** model.

3. To use this model in our code, we need to copy the model id
**`4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172`**

### JavaScript Example

#### **Basic Generation**

```javascript
// Generate a response from the model
LLM({
  engine: "4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172",
  command: "<encode>Your question here</encode>",
  paramValues: [
    { max_completion_tokens: 2000, temperature: 0.3 }
  ]
});
```

#### **With Image Input**

```javascript
// Using an image URL
LLM({
  engine: "4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172",
  command: "<encode>Your question with image</encode>",
  paramValues: [
    { image_url: "https://your_image_url.com" }
  ]
});

// Using a base64-encoded image
LLM({
  engine: "4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172",
  command: "<encode>Your question with image</encode>",
  paramValues: [
    { image_encoded: "base64_of_image" }
  ]
});
```

#### **ChatML-style Conversation**

```javascript
LLM({
  engine: "4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172",
  command: "<encode>ignore</encode>",
  paramValues: [
    {
      full_prompt: [
        { role: "system", content: "You are a helpful assistant." },
        { role: "user", content: "Who won the world series in 2020?" },
        { role: "assistant", content: "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020." },
        { role: "user", content: "Where was it played?" }
      ],
      max_completion_tokens: 2000,
      temperature: 0.3
    }
  ]
});
```

#### **Embeddings**

```javascript
Embeddings({
  engine: "4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172",
  values: ["Sample String 1", "Sample String 2"],
  paramValues: [{}]
});
```

### Python Example

```python
from ai_server import ModelEngine

# Initialize the model engine
model = ModelEngine(engine_id="4acbe913-df40-4ac0-b28a-daa5ad91b172", insight_id='${i}')

# Basic generation
question = 'Sample Question'
output = model.ask(question=question, param_dict={'max_completion_tokens': 2000, 'temperature': 0.3})

# With image input
output = model.ask(
    question='Sample Question With Image',
    param_dict={'image_url': 'https://your_image_url.com', 'max_completion_tokens': 2000, 'temperature': 0.3}
)
output = model.ask(
    question='Sample Question With Image',
    param_dict={'image_encoded': 'base64_of_image', 'max_completion_tokens': 2000, 'temperature': 0.3}
)

# ChatML-style conversation
output = model.ask(
    question='ignore',
    param_dict={
        "full_prompt": [
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Who won the world series in 2020?"},
            {"role": "assistant", "content": "The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."},
            {"role": "user", "content": "Where was it played?"}
        ],
        'max_completion_tokens': 2000,
        'temperature': 0.3
    }
)

# Embeddings
text_arr = ['Sample String 1', 'Sample String 2']
model.embeddings(strings_to_embed=text_arr)
```

> _**Note**: Replace the **Engine id** with the model specific to the preference or usecase._ 

---

### Notebook Integration (Python)

You can also interact with the model in a notebook environment:

```python
from semoss_sdk import call_model

result = call_model(model_id="your-model-id", prompt="What is the weather today?")
print(result["text"])
```

---

## Example in VS Code

Here is a simple application called Training Plan Generator which based on selected Technology, Level and Number of weeks A pre generated prompt will be generated which can be passed to a Model and be used to generate actual Training plan. 

```JavaScript
 useEffect(() => {
    if (technology && level && weeks) {
      setPrompt(`Create a training plan on ${technology}, for ${level} level, for ${weeks} weeks (each week is 5 working days, 8 hours per day) in a structured way and give the resources to study those topics.`);
    }
  }, [technology, level, weeks]);
```
