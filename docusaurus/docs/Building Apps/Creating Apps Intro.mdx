In AI Core, there are three different ways to create apps: Agent Builder, Drag and Drop, and Code. Here’s a brief overview of each method and the type of user who might prefer it:

- **Construct an agent**: A guided tool that helps users create apps through prompting. Users can create apps by specifying their requirements and edit the app using Drag and Drop System Components. Ideal for business users who may not have technical skills but need to create apps quickly and easily. It allows them to focus on business logic and requirements without worrying about the underlying code.
- **Drag and Drop**: This method allows users to create apps by dragging and dropping various components (like charts, tables, and forms) onto a canvas. It provides a visual way to build and configure apps. Suitable for admins who need to customize and manage apps without deep coding knowledge. It offers a balance between ease of use and flexibility, enabling them to design functional and visually appealing apps.
- **Code**: This method involves writing code to create and customize apps. It offers the highest level of flexibility and control, allowing for complex and highly customized solutions. Best for developers who have the technical expertise to write code. It allows them to leverage their programming skills to create sophisticated and tailored applications that meet specific business needs.
