The **Ask LLM Guide** provides a simple and intuitive interface that enables us to interact directly with a large language model (LLM) using plain language. Whether we’re looking to summarize content, generate ideas, answer domain-specific questions, or automate repetitive tasks, this page offers a quick way to leverage the power of AI without any coding. In the steps below, we’ll walkthrough how to use the sample LLM app using the available template. We can customize it to our needs using the **Design** and **Data** tabs.

If we encounter an error, it may be because we do not have access to the specific model used by this app. In that case, we can request access to the model or replace it with another available model from our catalog.

Save the app when all changes are finalized and share with other users.
