We can use the Landing Page Guide as a template to quickly create a simple landing page that will serve as a clean, branded entry to our app that introduces its purpose and guides users to key resources or actions. Whether we’re building an internal site or an external-facing experience, the landing page sets up a simple and user-friendly value that allows us to highlight important content like featured tools, links, or documentation. We can customize the page as per our needs using the Design and Data tabs.

To get started, Go to **App Library** home page and click on **Create New App**.

A sample landing page will open, pre-filled with editable content blocks.

We can use the **Design** tab to update the title, description, images, and resource links. Click on each block to customize it as needed. We can even update layout and spacing, adjust alignment, and apply brand colors to match our visual style using the **Block Settings**.

Once customized, our landing page becomes a central space for users to explore what our App offers.
