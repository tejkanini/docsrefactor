## Radio Block

In the Radio block you can multiple options to give to the user for them to select.

Mention all the option names as the Label and if they have to be selected or not in the value column.

### On Change

To ensure that our options are visible immediately when the user loads the corresponding page, we will implement an 'On Change' event. This will activate the display of options as soon as the page is loaded.

Click on '+ New Action' under On Click. Select 'Run Query' under Type and 'Options' under Query.
