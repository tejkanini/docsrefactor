# Slider Block

You can add a Slider Block as part of your UI. Follow the steps below to add a Slider Block to your app UI.

## Block Settings

### Content

Make sure you are in the 'Block' tab (inside the 'Dev' tab) on your page. The Dev section and the Block section are highlighted in the image below.

Scroll down the various block options until you reach 'Slider' (under the heading of Input). The Slider block is highlighted in the image below.

<!-- TODO need slider image -->
<!-- ![Slider](../../../../static/img/SystemComponents/Slider.png) -->

Drag and drop the **Slider** Block into your App UI. Once you drop the block in your UI, you will see various parameters for which data needs to be populated on the right side of the screen. If you do not see this, click on **Block Settings**. The Block Settings tab is highlighted in the image below.

### Parameters

#### Slider Type

You can select the slider type to be Continuous (in which you will see a smooth line) or you can choose it to be Discrete (in which you will see multiple points on the slider line).

#### Value

Here you need to select the Minimum Value and the Maximum Value that a user can enter on the slider.

### On Change

We want our options to be visible as soon as the user loads the corresponding page. Thus we will create a page load to enable this.

Click on 'Save' to finish.

Congratulations, you have successfully added a Slider Block to your UI.
