## Button Block

Whatever you want your button to read like - Submit, or Yes, or Okay, or I agree, you can mention that in the Label tab.

### On Click

We want our options to be visible as soon as the user loads the corresponding page. Thus we will create a 'On Click' entry to enable this.

> To be added

Finally mention the Appearance and Doimensions of your button block.


Congratulations you have successfully added an Button block to your UI.
