# Ratings

You can add a Ratings block to your App interface to allow users to rate items. Drag and drop the Ratings block into your app UI, as highlighted below.

<!-- ![Ratings](../../../../static/img/SystemComponents/Ratings.png) -->

## Block Settings

### Content

Select the type of rating you would like to include as part of the display: heart or stars. Then, select the maximum rating a user can choose.

### Appearance

Select the size of the block

### On Change

To ensure our options are visible as soon as the user loads the corresponding page, we will create a page load action.

Click on '+ New Action' under On Change. Select 'Run Query' under Type and 'Options' under Query.

Click on 'Save' to finish.

Congratulations, you have successfully added a Ratings block to your UI.
