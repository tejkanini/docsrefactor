# Glossary
Before you start your AI Core, you can refer to the below mentioned glossary which lists down the definition of important terminologies and topics.

## C

**CLI Secret Field**:
A CLI (Command Line Interface) secret field is a secure input field used in command-line tools to enter sensitive information such as passwords or API keys without displaying the input on the screen, thereby protecting it from being exposed to unauthorized users

**Container**:
A lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings

## D

**Docker**:
A platform that uses containers to enable developers to package applications and their dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, ensuring consistency across different environments

**Dockerized Deployment**:
Dockerized Deployment refers to the process of packaging an application and its dependencies into a Docker container, enabling consistent and efficient deployment across various environments


## E

**EKS Cluster**:
A managed Kubernetes service by AWS that simplifies running Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install and operate your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes.

**Engines**:
Core components or software systems that perform essential functions, such as rendering graphics, processing data, or executing scripts, within an application or platform.

## F

**Frames**:
In computing, frames can refer to different concepts depending on the context:

    - Web Development: HTML frames are used to divide a web page into multiple sections, each of which can load a separate HTML document.
    - Networking: Data frames are units of data transmitted across a network, containing headers, payload, and trailers.
    - Graphics: Frames refer to individual images in a sequence of images that create animation or video.

## H

**Helper Scripts**:
Small programs or pieces of code designed to perform specific tasks or simplify complex operations within a larger software application

## P

**Pixel Call**:
Pixel is a domain-specific language (DSL) specific to AI Core that is used as the payload for all the operations that can be performed on an insight. Every Pixel has a Java class to handle the business logic on the backend; we call this Java class a "Reactor"

## R

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation**:
A technique in natural language processing that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses

**Role-Based Access Control**:
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security approach that restricts system access to authorized users based on their roles within an organization, ensuring that individuals can only access the information and resources necessary for their job functions

**Running scripts**:
The process of executing a series of commands or instructions written in a scripting language to automate tasks or perform specific functions within a software environment. This can be done through a command line interface (CLI), integrated development environment (IDE), or task scheduler

## S

**Semantic Search**:
Refers to the process of improving search accuracy by understanding the intent and contextual meaning behind search queries

**SSO login**:
Single Sign-On (SSO) login is an authentication process that allows a user to access multiple applications or systems with one set of login credentials, enhancing user convenience and security by reducing the need to remember multiple usernames and passwords

## T

**Tag-Based Data Security**:
Tag-Based Data Security is a method of protecting data by assigning metadata tags to data elements, which define access controls and security policies based on these tags, allowing for more granular and dynamic data protection across various environments and use cases

**Terraform**:
An open-source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently using a declarative configuration language

**Trustworthy AI™**:
Trustworthy AI™ requires governance and regulatory compliance throughout the AI lifecycle from ideation to design, development, deployment, and machine learning operations (MLOps) anchored on the seven dimensions in Deloitte's Trustworthy AI™ framework—transparent and explainable, fair and impartial, robust and reliable, respectful of privacy, safe and secure, and responsible and accountable

## W

**Workflows**:
A series of automated steps or processes designed to accomplish a specific task or set of tasks, often used to streamline and manage complex operations in software development and other fields

## Y

**YAML**:
A human-readable data serialization standard, often used for configuration files and data exchange between languages with different data structures.
