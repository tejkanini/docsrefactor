## Usage

The Usage tab shows how to use the Storage in JavaScript, Python, Langchain API and Java.

![Usage of a Storage](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/Storage%20Catalog/StorageCatalogUsage.png)

These commands demonstrate how to use the storage engine via the Terminal app and within any apps that you create. These commands are not to be confused with the SDK which are seperate.

```
# Initialize the storage engine
from gaas_gpt_storage import StorageEngine
storageEngine = StorageEngine(engine_id = "2d905aa3-b703-4c98-8133-5bcaefddac1e", insight_id = '${i}')
```

```
# List the files on your storage path
storageEngine.list(storagePath = "my_s3_storage_path")
```

```
# List the files on your storage path with extra details
storageEngine.listDetails(storagePath = "my_s3_storage_path")
```

```
# Sync'ing your local folder to the specified storage directory
# Space can be the project id, "user" or "insight"
# This is where the local path starts
# So in this case, the local path starts in the project directory
storageEngine.syncLocalToStorage(storagePath="my/s3/storage/path", localPath="/my/local/dir", space="my_project_id")
```

```
# Sync'ing your storage directory to the local folder
# Space can be the project id, "user" or "insight"
storageEngine.syncStorageToLocal(storagePath="my/s3/storage/path", localPath="/my/local/dir", space="my_project_id")
```

```
# Upload a folder or file from your local project/insight/user directory to the specified storage directory
storageEngine.copyToStorage(storagePath="my/s3/storage/path", localPath="/my/local/dir", space="my_project_id")
```

```
# Download a folder or file from the specified storage directory to your local project/insight/user directory
storageEngine.copyToLocal(storagePath="my/s3/storage/path", localPath="/my/local/dir", space="my_project_id")
```

```
# Delete a folder or file from the specified storage directory
storageEngine.deleteFromStorage(storagePath = 'your/storage/file/path', leaveFolderStructure=False)
```

## Access Control
The Access Control tab allows authors of the storage to change storage permissions

### Add members
You can grant access to other users by clicking on Add Member. When adding a member you will have to select which [permission level](../../Getting%20Started//Platform%20Navigation/Settings/Permissions.mdx) to grant.

### Pending Requests
Users can request access to your storage if it is  [Discoverable](#discoverable-storages), these requests will be visible in Pending Requests. 

![storage Access](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/AppLibrary/PendingRequests.png)

### Public storage
Making a storage public allows all users to have READ-ONLY access to the storage. Users would also be allowed to request access to the storage.

### Discoverable Storage
Making a storage discoverable allows all users to request access to the storage.
[Request Access for Discoverable Storages](#discoverable-storages)

### Discoverable Storages
If an storage is discoverable other users can request access to the storage.

![Discoverable Storages](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Discoverable.png)

Click on **Request Access** near the top-right corner and a pop-up will provide you with 3 options to choose from - Author, Editor & Read-Only. You can choose the option based on your role and request.
