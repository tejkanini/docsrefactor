# Database Catalog

Databases are organized data that is linked with Gen AI Apps on AI Core and can be used by those Apps to use data. Databases enable Apps to provide results as per requirement. You can create a new database or add locally available databases to AI Core which can be then connected to Apps.

To navigate to the Database Catalog, click on the **cylinderical** icon on the left side of AI Core portal which will take you to Data catalog.

{/* Add a picture of the database catalog main page */}


## Pre-requisites

- Before adding a Database to your AI Core instance, it must be detached from any existing instance otherwise it might return an error.
- When you attach a Database, all data files for the Database must be available

## Adding a Database

### Postgres Example
Let us take the example of Postgres which is an open-source relational database management system that supports both SQL and JSON querying.

Click on **Postgres** to start the connection process.

![Postgres](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/Database%20Catalog/Postgres%20Database.png)

As we can see in the above image, to connect to Postgres, we need to fill the required information. Let us understand them one by one.

#### Catalog Name
This is a user specific information. It refers to the Database name or the Connection name.

#### Database Description
Here we can write some information describing for what we are creating a database. We can write about the functionality of our database. For example, the database will store information of a chatbot of a company, we can mention that.

#### Tags
Just as Database Description, we can include Tags to describe about the functionality of our database. However, both Database Description and Tags are optional info to include.

#### Hostname
Hostname is the url address where our Database will be established. This is a credential the user optains from the admin of the database.

#### Port and Database
As you can see, both the Port number and the Database name are autofilled. Both are Database specific information.

#### Schema
Schema, which is autofilled, is another layer of nomenclature given to the database for the purpose of differentiation.

#### Username and Password

These are the credentials of the corresponsing database we want to connect our catalog with.

#### JBDC url
This is the same as the Hostname.

#### Final Steps
When all the parameters have been filled, click on Create Database button.

Here you will see all the tables housed inside the database we are trying to connect with. Select the tables we need to establish the connect with and confirm.

Congratulations, you have completed the connection process!

![Database Access](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/AppLibrary/PendingRequests.png)

### Public Database
Making a database public allows all users to have READ-ONLY access to the database. Users would also be allowed to request access to the database.

### Discoverable Database
Making a database discoverable allows all users to request access to the database.
[Request Access for Discoverable Apps](#discoverable-databases)

### Discoverable Databases
If a database is discoverable other users can request access to the database.
