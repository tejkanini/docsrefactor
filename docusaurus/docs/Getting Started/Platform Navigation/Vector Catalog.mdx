# Vector Catalog

A vector database is a specialized solution designed for the storage, indexing, and retrieval of massive datasets containing unstructured data. These databases leverage machine learning models and their embeddings to facilitate searching across various forms of unstructured data, including images, video, text, audio, and more. This is done with the help of pixel calls, a domain specific language (DSL) specific to AI Core that is used as the payload for all the operations that can be performed on an insight.

### Adding a Vector Database

To connect to a vector database, go to **App Library > Vector Catalog**

Click on **Add Vector** on the top-right section and it will take to different type of connections for Vector.

Choose an appropriate **Connection** based on your requirements.
![ConnectYourVector](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/Vector%20Catalog/Vector.png)

In this example, we will create a FAISS vector

Fill in the required FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) details. Click on **Add Vector**.
![AddDetails](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/Add%20Vector%20Details.PNG)

Your vector database is now ready to use.

## Embed Documents

To embed documents in your vector database, open your vector in the vector catalog.

Go to **Files**.

Click on **+ Embed New Document** to upload your data file. It only accepts files with .txt, .csv, ,pdf, .doc, .ppt extensions.
![Embed Data](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew5.png)

Click on **upload files** to select and upload your data and click on **Embed**. You can also drag and drop your file to the same window.
![Upload Files](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew6.png)

You should now be able to see your file inside the vector database.
![Data Files](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew7.png)

If you have questions regarding the policies or your datasets, go to **Q&A** tab and type in your query in the space provided.
![Q&A Tab](../../../static/img/Navigating/CFG%20AI%20Walkthrough/vectordbnew9.png)

Once the file is uploaded, run the following command.

`CreateEmbeddingsFromDocuments ( engine = "80a482d5-06b7-4ff6-bedc-0d0570b7bfeb" , filePaths = [ "TestFile.csv" ] , paramValues = [ { "columnsToIndex" : [ "content" ] } ] ) ;`

![EmbedDB](../../../static/img/VectorDatabase/EmbedDB.png)

> Execute this command to embed your vector database with the .csv file

- This will take a while to run. Once completed, your vector database is ready to use.

> **Note**
> The engine ID above needs to match the engine ID of the vector database you just created.

- To do so, go back to App Library > Vector Catalog by clicking the vector icon on the left-side.

> To be Added 

> Look for the database you just created.

### Custom Chunking

Custom chunking refers to the process of breaking down large pieces of data, such as documents, audio, or images, into smaller, manageable chunks before loading them into a vector database. This process optimizes the storage, retrieval, and processing of data within the database.


#### Upload a .csv file 
To achieve this we will upload a .csv file to the vector database with the following columns:

- **Source**: Name of the source doucment
- **Modality**: The method by which this chunk was produced (e.g., text, audio, image, etc.)
- **Divider**: The page from which this content was extracted (this is a string and can be values like 1, 2, etc., for content parsed across multiple pages)
- **Part**: integer for the part in the page it is grabbed from. If a page has dense text relative to the max tokens this will increase from 0 to n for that page
- **Tokens**: Integer for the number of tokens for the content
- **Content**: The actual string of the content grabbed

**Example**
```csv
Source,Modality,Divider,Part,Tokens,Content
Executive,text,1,2,475,"your content"
Executive,text,2,3,511,"your content"
Executive,text,3,4,498,"your content"
Executive,text,3,4,500,"your content"
```

## Usage
The usage tab for a database tells you how to use the database in JavaScript, Python, Langchain API and Java.

![Usage of a Vector](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/Vector%20Catalog/VectorCatalogUsage.png)

## Access Control
The Access Control tab allows authors of the vector to change vector permissions

### Add members
You can grant access to other users by clicking on Add Member. When adding a member you will have to select which [permission level](../../Getting%20Started//Platform%20Navigation/Settings/Permissions.mdx) to grant.

### Pending Requests
Users can request access to your vector if it is  [Discoverable](#discoverable-vectors), these requests will be visible in Pending Requests. 

![Vector Access](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/AppLibrary/PendingRequests.png)

### Public vector
Making a vector public allows all users to have READ-ONLY access to the vector. Users would also be allowed to request access to the vector.

### Discoverable Vector
Making a vector discoverable allows all users to request access to the vector.
[Request Access for Discoverable Vectors](#discoverable-vectors)

### Discoverable Vectors
If an vector is discoverable other users can request access to the vector.

![Discoverable Vectors](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Discoverable.png)

Click on **Request Access** near the top-right corner and a pop-up will provide you with 3 options to choose from - Author, Editor & Read-Only. You can choose the option based on your role and request.
