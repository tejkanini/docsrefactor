# App Library

App Library is a section in AI Core which consists of list of Gen AI applications present on the platform that are created by users. Once you click on a particular app in the App Library, it will open the App which is ready to use.

## Creating a new App

To create a new App, click on the top right corner of the homepage on **Create New App**.

![New App Button](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Create%20New%20App.png)

You can choose among the 4 different options of creating a new app. These are,

1. Code - You can build an app by coding using a framework or even from strach

    How to build a Code App has been covered in detail [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/React%20App%20In-Depth%20Guide.md).

2. Drag and Drop - This is no-code option of creating a new app

    How to build a Drag and Drop App has been covered in detail [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/By%20Drag%20&%20Drop.mdx).

3.  Agent Builder - This is also a no-code solution

    How to build an Agent Builder App has been covered in detail [here](../../How%20To/App%20Creation%20Guides/By%20Agent%20Builder.md).

4. Template App

    If you don't want to build your app from scratch, you can choose utilize a template from the list of templates.

![Create New App Options](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Start%20build%20with%20a%20template.png)


After clicking the Create button in any of our tools, users are prompted to enter key app details like:
- name: The name of the app
- description: Description of the app
- app image: You can add a custom image for your app
- tags: When developing a new application, incorporating tags can significantly enhance both organization and navigation. Tags can be associated with various aspects of the app, such as its functionality or design. For example, if your app helps users plan trip itineraries, you might use tags like "travel planner" or "itinerary creator." These tags enable you to efficiently filter and locate the desired app within your entire library.

### Preview App

The Preview App button allows you to view and interact with your app as users would see it before it is published. This feature helps you test the user experience and overall layout without saving any changes made during the preview. If you notice anything that needs improvement, you can easily return to editing to make adjustments. Using the preview ensures your app meets your expectations before going live.

### Share App

The Share App button allows you to easily distribute your app to others.

![Share App](../../../static/autoImg/PlatformNavigation/App%20Library/Share%20App.png)

We can share an App in two ways: 
#### URL

The is the most direct and quickest way of sharing an app with someone is using the URL option, one can copy the URL by clicking on the copy options right beside the URL, and share that link with others that you wanted to share. 

![Sharing via Url](../../../static/img/AppSharing/UrlSharing.png)


#### iFrame
Another way you can share the app is by sharing them the IFrame link of the app, to share an app using IFrame click on the IFrame tab  beside URL and you can copy the IFrame link and share it with others.

![Sharing via Iframe](../../../static/img/AppSharing/IframeSharing.png)
              
Using this way you can embed the app as an iframe. In the **HTML** code the website where you want to embed this app inside the body tag of that website paste this iframe tag contents that you copied by clicking the button in sharing menu. 

```html
<iframe frameborder="0"
            width="1000"
            height="600"
            style="border: 1px solid #ccc;" 
            src="https://workshop.cfg.deloitte.com/cfg-ai-dev/SemossWeb/packages/client/dist/#/s/d56c69e5-6ca0-47f9-ba41-e00eef987b45">
</iframe>
```

The attributes in the iframe tag can be changed accordingly to our use the default values such as frameborder, width, height, style etc. are defined such that the most suitable/optimised values, but feel free to change them to the required use.



### Save App

The Save App button ensures that all your changes and progress are securely stored as you work on your app. By clicking this button regularly, you can prevent accidental data loss and easily restore previous versions if needed. Some platforms may also offer an auto-save feature, so it’s a good idea to check your settings for additional protection. Consistently saving your work helps maintain the integrity of your app development process.

### Show App

The Show App button lets you preview your app exactly as end users will see it. This feature is useful for verifying that everything appears and functions correctly after publishing, and for spotting any issues or missing content. The view is read-only, so if you need to make changes, simply return to the editing mode. Using Show App helps ensure your app is ready for your audience.
