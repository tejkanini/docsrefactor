# How To Write Unit Tests in SEMOSS UI


Unit testing helps ensure code is reliable, maintainable, and functions as expected in isolation. In SEMOSS UI, we use **Vitest** for testing while following a consistent folder structure to keep tests organized and discoverable.

This guide will walk through:

- SEMOSS UI's expected test directory structure
- How to write unit tests using Vitest
- Where to find good examples in the existing codebase

---

## Test Directory Structure

SEMOSS UI tests are inside of each corresponding library or package within their own testing folder. The folders are named according to what is being tested and 
the test file name is the same as the component being tested.

```plaintext
semoss/
└── libs/
    └── renderer/
            ├── src/
            |    └── components/
            |           └── block-defaults/
            │                   └── block/
            |                           └── Block.tsx
            | 
            └── testing/
                    └── block-defaults/
                            └── Block.spec.tsx
       
```
By default, tests must contain .test. or .spec. in their file name.

**Writing Unit Tests with Vitest**

Vitest is a modern framework designed for speed and simplicity. Vitest uses a syntax similar to Jest where certain
key words make organizing tests easy.

The documentation can be found here https://vitest.dev/guide/

Here’s a basic example that will test a Block within the SEMOSS drag-and-drop application and test whether the block is correctly 
rendering:

```plaintext

import { Block } from "@/components/block-defaults/block/Block";
import { render, screen } from "../utils";

const blocks = {
	"block": {
		data: {},
		id: "block-test",
		widget: "block",
		listeners: {},
		slots: {},
	},
};

describe("Block default", async () => {
	it("Should render the  block", async () => {
		const { container } = await render(<Block id="block-test" />, {
			blocks: blocks,
		});

		const element = container.querySelector("[data-block='block']");
		expect(element).toBeInTheDocument();
	});
});

```
Key words used within the test:
	1.	**Describe** groups tests together
	2.	**It** defines an individual test case and is used when a test "should" do something
	3.	**Expect** asserts the expected outcome

**Existing Test Examples**

SEMOSS UI already includes a rich set of unit tests. If you’re unsure how to test something, look around:
	1.	Go to the testing folder
	2.	Find the package matching your component, or a related one
	3.	Open an existing *spec.tsx or *test.tsx file

⸻

**Next Steps** \
	•   Start by writing a small test for any new component you write. \
	•	Review existing test files when you’re stuck. \
	•	Reach out to your team or the CFG AI support group at [CFGAI@deloitte.com](mailto:CFGAI@deloitte.com) if you’re not sure how to test a specific component.
